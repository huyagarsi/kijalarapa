I will say though, that it was a great jumpstart to get [my body] back to where I was.”</p><p>The MTV personality explained that she felt “a little bit” of pressure to snap back after becoming a mom. “Obviously, I’m getting into doing a whole new show and I knew I was going to be back on camera so soon,” she told Us. “So I wanted to look good, not just for myself, but also for my fans and for all the people watching the show. I don’t want people to watch and be like, ‘Wait, this isn’t the Chanel I love.’ You know what I mean?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/Chanel-West-Coast-Says-Postpartum-Liposuction-Was-Worse-Than-C-Section-2022-MTV.jpg><p>Chanel welcomed her daughter, Bowie Breeze, with <a href=#>boyfriend <strong>Dom Fenison</strong></a> in November 2022.
