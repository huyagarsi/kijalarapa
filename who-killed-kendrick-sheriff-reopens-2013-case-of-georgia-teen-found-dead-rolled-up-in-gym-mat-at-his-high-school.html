The investigation will consist partially of interviews and meetings with other law enforcement agencies to see if anything was missed during the earlier investigation. Paulk said the investigation would likely last at least six months.</p><p>“We’ll go through every bit of it,” Paulk vowed. “If we found a contradiction, we’re going resolve any contradiction.”</p><p>Investigators say Johnson was trying to retrieve a shoe when he died of asphyxiation after getting stuck in a head-down position in the rolled-up mat that was standing on one end, but his family says he was murdered by schoolmates.</p><p>The two autopsies the family had performed indicated Johnson died of blunt force trauma, which conflicts with an initial autopsy showing the cause of death was asphyxiation.</p><p>In addition to identifying “apparent non-accidental, blunt force trauma” as a cause of death, the third autopsy also found that some of Johnson’s organs were missing from previous postmortems.</p><p>“Who killed Kendrick?” Coleman, the family spokesperson asked. “Where’s his clothes? Where’s his organs? There’s so many flags here.”</p><p>In a 2019 lawsuit, the family claimed Johnson’s organs were removed in an effort to interfere with the investigation into his death.</p><p>Paulk expressed confidence in the reinvestigation of the case, saying, “We are confident in what [we] will come up with will be the truth.</p><p>“I want to start fresh with it and look at all the way through. I think the community deserves it.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX9ye49sZmpoX6y1sHnKoqOlnZRiuKa6w6ugnKNdqLWmvsifnWaqlaS9prrSZmlpaWNisKK%2FxGamn2WXmryzs8iaZK2dlaN6p7vUp5tmnJWWsW6%2BzqWjnpxdqr1utc1mnrKlXaKutXnArWShoaNitaqzx2aqnKCfpLlw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
