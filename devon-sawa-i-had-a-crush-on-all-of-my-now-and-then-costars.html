Scott Wormer may not have been as bad as his brothers, but <a href=#><strong>Devon Sawa</strong></a>, who played him in 1995’s Now and Then, still thinks that he would have ended up behind bars.</p><p>“Scott Wormer is in prison now,” the 37-year-old exclusively tells Us Weekly. “He robbed a liquor store.” Comparing him to <a href=#>his Little Giants character,</a> he adds: “Junior was a little bit more innocent than Scott Wormer.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/devon-sawa.jpg><p>Sawa starred in the beloved film alongside <a href=#><strong>Christina Ricci</strong></a> (Roberta), <strong>Thora Birch</strong> (Teeny), <strong>Ashleigh Aston Moore</strong> (Chrissy) and <strong>Gaby Hoffmann</strong> (Samantha). He previously worked with Ricci in Casper.</p><p>“I’m not 100 percent sure but I think Christina suggested me for it and I auditioned and put myself on video cassette again and a few weeks later I was in Atlanta, Georgia, shooting it. I think Christina had put in a good word for me before the audition,” he says. “Pulp Fiction came out that summer and while we were shooting it [Christina and I] went and saw it four, five, six times. I remember <strong>Demi [Moore]</strong> was a producer on it so she was there the whole time and she let me talk to<strong> Bruce Willis</strong> once on the phone. They had one of those old-fashioned cell phones on set. It was Bruce Willis on the line! It was amazing.” (Moore and Willis were married from 1987 to 2000.)</p><p>Moore also appeared in the movie, which told the summer adventure that four 12-year-old girls had in 1970. Roberta, Teeny, Samantha and Chrissy raised money for a tree house, found out the truth about Crazy Pete, and were terrorized by the Wormers. Roberta, however, developed feelings for Junior and the pair secretly shared a kiss — and a soda pop — together.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/devon-sawa-christina-ricci-now-and-then-zoom.jpg><p>“She was younger than me by a couple of years. I didn’t find [the kissing scene] to be awkward,” Sawa tells Us of the actress, who he’s seen “a few times over the years” since. “I think at a young age I just had the ability to not think about the cameras and everything and just be in the zone. I didn’t really think about what was going on around me. I just did what I had to do.”</p><p>The actor <a href=#>did develop feelings for Ricci off set, though.</a> “I had a crush on all the girls. I had a crush on Gaby, I had a crush on Christina — all the girls,” he says. “I was the only guy on set. It was a great summer.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJuerp%2BjerSt1ppkomWYlrFurYycqa6rmGK8r3nApaNmp5Ziurp5zaiuZpmemXq1tMSnZJyno6mus7%2BO</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
