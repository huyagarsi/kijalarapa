It was beyond epic and inspiring. This place is absolute heaven — no wonder Marlon Brando worshipped it.”</p><p>Actor Sterling Jones has also been posting Instagram Stories from the Rebel Island birthday trip as a guest, as has “Entertainment Tonight” host Carly Steel.</p><p>Wilson also captioned a shot on Instagram of herself with two more pals, “Zahra is one of my besties from high school who now crushes it as a lawyer in Manhattan and Lorelei is my former Youth Ambassador friend (when we toured Southern Africa) who now works literally for world peace. And they’re both Moms who crush it every day!”</p><p>The group was wearing lots of neon colors on the beach for the ’80s-themed party — with slimmed-down Wilson donning a hot pink top that said “Let’s Get Physical.” Pals also seemed to be outfitted with some fun Rebel Island swag.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><p>The Brando is the same spot where <a href=#>Kim Kardashian celebrated her 40th birthday</a> last year with her family, and DiCaprio celebrated his 42nd birthday in 2016 with his mom and then-girlfriend Nina Agdal.</p><p>The resort on late Hollywood icon Brando’s private Tetiaroa atoll in French Polynesia includes “35 villas on white-sand beaches frequented by sea turtles, manta rays and exotic birds.” It also reportedly utilizes solar energy and “seawater air conditioning,” with the goal of having “zero carbon impact.”</p><p><a href=#>This post first appeared on Nypost.com</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnopqvpriMsKClq5%2BjeqSxy56Zq5mknruoeZNqqq1lkp6%2FtbTDmrBmp55iuqK%2By6ilZpqilrulu9Jmp6uhppbBpnnIrKOappRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
