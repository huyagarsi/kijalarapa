SAASA has three different fee plans for visitors depending on the number of sanctuaries that one wants to visit. The three sanctuaries are Monkeyland, Birds of Eden and the Jukani Wildlife Sanctuary.

You are advised to carry sunscreen and mosquito repellant and you should be dressed appropriately for walking comfortably. A tour guide shall be provided. The following are the<a href=# title="birds of eden" rel="nofollow noopener"> payment plans</a>:</p><h3>1. Single ticket</h3><p class=align-left>As the name suggests, you get to visit only one of the sanctuaries and so it is the cheapest plan available. The duration for the plan is eight hours where you pay R280 and R140 for adults and children between 3-12 years old respectively. You get to pick from any of the three sanctuaries. This price is valid until 31st October 2020. From 1st November 2020 to 31st October 2021, adults will need to pay R320 and kids - R160.</p><h3>2. Combo ticket</h3><p class=align-left>This is an improvement on the first plan above. The combo sanctuary plan allows you to pick from two sanctuaries for eight hours. Adults will pay R450 while children between 3-12 years will part R225. As a bonus, you are not required to hit both sanctuaries in a day. From 1st November 2020, the rates will be R540 for adults and R270 for children.</p><h3>3. TripTic ticket</h3><p class=align-left>You guessed it! This plan gives you a chance to visit all three for a maximum of eight hours each. Adults and children pay R560 and R280 respectively. Just like the above plan, you do not need to visit the three all in a day. After 31st October 2020, the charges will be R640.00 per adult and R320 for kids.</p><p class=align-left>Please note that the disabled people do not pay.
