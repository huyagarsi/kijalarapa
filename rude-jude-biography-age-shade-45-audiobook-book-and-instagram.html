He writes about his sexual encounters–both strange and intimate–alongside stories from his childhood and his tell-all experiences with “science drugs.” Throughout it all, Jude is critical of himself and his actions, proving himself to be vulnerable, lonely, and extremely relatable. A stellar follow-up toHyena.</p><p><strong>Originally published:</strong> September 19, 2017<br><strong>Genre</strong>: Autobiographical novel</p><ul><li><strong>Hyena</strong></li></ul><p>Jude Angeliniâe(tm)s tales of depravity are uncompromising, brutally honest and shocking. From growing up poor in a factory town outside Detroit to his adult life as a popular radio personality on Sirius XM, Hyena charts Angeliniâe(tm)s descent into ever more debauched sexual and drug-fuelled exploits, from one-armed strippers, women with abuse-fantasies and a night on dust that he thinks heâe(tm)ll never wake up from.</p><p>Yet underneath this series of deplorable autobiographical stories is an echo of heartbreak, loneliness, and the eternal poetry of a man struggling to be heard. Vividly told in his distinctive voice, Jude Angeliniâe(tm)s fi rst book is a blackly comic masterpiece.</p><p><strong>Originally published:</strong> December 11, 2013<br><strong>Genres</strong>: Humour, Fiction</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rude-jude-twitter></span><span>Rude Jude Twitter</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Tweets by rude_jude</p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rude-jude-instagram></span><span>Rude Jude Instagram</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=rude-jude-new-orleans></span><span>Rude Jude New Orleans</span><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><h1 style=text-align:center><span>Rude Jude Interview</span></h1><p><b>HipHopDX:&nbsp;</b><i>Hyena</i>&nbsp;is your first book. You spent five years writing it. It’s called&nbsp;<i>Hyena</i>&nbsp;because hyenas will laugh at you but nothing’s really funny. There are a lot of dark narratives in the book. What made you want to present your life, or the portions of your life that you remember in this manner?</p><p><b>Rude Jude:&nbsp;</b>Here’s the deal: I didn’t go to college. I’m really not fucking educated. If you go to the bookstore, most of the people that are writing books are college-educated. A lot of them are from middle class or upper middle class backgrounds. They know sentence structure and they understand big words and shit. That wasn’t me. I felt like that was a disadvantage to me, but then I felt like “What do I have working for me?” I have voice and life. My life was different than their life. A lot of it was dark and I wrote that. I just told the truth. My main shit was when I was writing, show don’t tell and tell the truth. That’s it. I’ll just tell you what happened. Like, “Aight, this fucking chick peed on me.” You can feel however you want about a chick peeing on you. I let anybody come up with how they feel about it but, yo, she pissed on me. I liked it. It was cool. I’d do it again.</p><p><b>DX:&nbsp;</b>There’s a lot of seriousness in the book as well. You mentioned your father earlier. There’s a story about him taking you to the dentist and you realized how important insurance is, how much it costs to make sure your kids are taken care of. Those are the narratives that linger longer for me after reading the book than, ironically, one-armed strippers and things.</p><p><b>Rude Jude:&nbsp;</b>I was aware of my core audience and what they would respond to. I do a Hip Hop show. I’m a shock jock on a Hip Hop channel so of course sex stories and violent stories are gonna resonate. But I also wanted to talk about that real shit: heartbreak, growing up broke, the insecurity of not having or not knowing if y’all are gonna be able to pay rent that next month and how that weighs on a person and how one develops an inferiority complex because of that. I wanted to talk about that as well.</p><p><strong>Adopted from:&nbsp;hiphopdx.com</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKqlmbJuttSdnGaamaS0s63PobBmmZeaerS0wJ2cZmxlYq62sMiomainm2KvsLvKZpinnF2eu7TAwKCpmqVf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
