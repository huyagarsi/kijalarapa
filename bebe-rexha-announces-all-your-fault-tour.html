I'm going to as many countries as possible for my <a href=#>#Rexhars</a>. ?</p><p>— Bebe Rexha (@BebeRexha) <a href=#>January 24, 2017</a></p><p>The Brooklyn native kicks off her North American shows on March 1 in Dallas, Texas and will wrap up at the end of the month in Washington, D.C. Although it is Rexha’s first time headlining her own tour, the 27-year-old has previously opened for big names such as Nick Jonas and Elle Goulding, as well as co-headlined Warped Tour.</p><p>Earlier this month, Rexha told Daily Star that her upcoming album is “extremely personal.”</p><p>“I did not hold back, I talk about everything from ex-boyfriends to friends, and growing up in LA,” she spilled. I’m very insecure and I tend to hold things close to my heart, the album is purely about me and my experiences so that’s a huge thing. I do believe in myself, it’s just that everyone will judge me on this and that’s hard, I’ve not played it to many people, I tend not to want to show it off before it’s out.”</p><p>“I Got You,” the second single off All Your Fault is&nbsp;Rexha’s first Hot 100 as a lead artist; however, she has penned and been featured on chart-topping hits including David Guetta’s&nbsp;“Hey Mama” and G-Easy’s “Me, Myself & I.”</p><h4>You can watch the singstress’&nbsp;Tonight Show performance of “I Got You” below, followed by her tour dates.
