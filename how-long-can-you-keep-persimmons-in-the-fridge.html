It can take one to two months to air dry. When dried, the persimmons should feel leathery but still pliable. You can also freeze persimmons to use later in baked items.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Should_I_refrigerate_Fuyu_persimmons></span>Should I refrigerate Fuyu persimmons?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fuyus, though, should always be firm. How to store: Persimmons, particularly Hachiyas, should be kept at room temperature until they are fully ripe. Then <b>they can be refrigerated for as long as a couple of weeks</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_store_unripe_persimmons></span>How do you store unripe persimmons?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Unripe persimmons will <b>keep in the refrigerator for up to one month. Keep refrigerated persimmons unwashed in a plastic bag. Freeze. Hachiya-type persimmons can be placed in a single layer on a baking sheet and frozen until solid.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_I_freeze_persimmons></span>Can I freeze persimmons?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>Yes, you can freeze persimmons.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_store_persimmons_in_the_freezer></span>How do you store persimmons in the freezer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Place the persimmons on a tray and freeze them for <b>1 to 2 hours. Spread your persimmons out on a baking tray in a single layer. Put the tray in the freezer for a few hours to make them firm and harden up. You can also put your persimmons in a bag, but they might take a little longer to get firm.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Will_persimmons_ripen_in_the_fridge></span>Will persimmons ripen in the fridge?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Allow the fruit to ripen at room temperature or <b>store in the refrigerator for up to a month or frozen for up to eight months. If you wish to hasten the ripening process, store the persimmons in a bag with a ripe apple or banana. They give off ethylene gas that speeds the ripening process.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_know_when_a_persimmon_has_gone_bad></span>How do you know when a persimmon has gone bad?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p><b>An unripe persimmon can ruin your whole day. Even a small bite of a Hachiya persimmon that isn’t squishy and practically dribbling-on-the-floor ripe can make you grimace. It tastes chalky, astringent and altogether horrid. It also gives persimmons a bad name.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_long_do_fresh_persimmons_last_in_the_fridge></span>How long do fresh persimmons last in the fridge?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Once Hachiyas are soft, move them to the fridge where they should keep for <b>at least two or three more weeks.

Once very ripe, place in a Gladxae Food Storage Zipper Bag but do not close. Or, place ripe persimmons in a bowl in the fridge that has been loosely covered with Gladxae ClingWrap. <b>Keep in the crisper drawer of the refrigerator</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Why_are_unripe_persimmons_so_bad></span>Why are unripe persimmons so bad?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>What is astringency? It’s a term you may be used to hearing in relation to bad red wine or overbrewed tea — it indicates the presence of tannins, a flavor compound with a bitter, dry, furry, sandpapery mouthfeel. <b>Unripe persimmons have very, very high levels of tannins, hence the name dry fruit!</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_you_freeze_persimmons_whole></span>Can you freeze persimmons whole?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you’re worried about freezer burn, place your persimmons into an airtight container before you freeze them. <b>You can freeze whole persimmons indefinitely, but they’ll start to lose their taste and texture after about 3 months.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_can_I_do_with_a_lot_of_persimmons></span>What can I do with a lot of persimmons?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>One of the best options for copious amounts of any food is to freeze some for later. HalfPint suggests pureeing the persimmon pulp, putting it into plastic freezer bags to maximize your freezer space, and then making <b>persimmon bread, smoothies, and steamed pudding with the thawed fruit pulp later on.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_preserve_fresh_persimmons></span>How do you preserve fresh persimmons?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Persimmons should be kept <b>at room temperature until ripe.

Fuyu persimmons freeze well and, like peaches, they make a nice accompaniment to ice cream. As with other fruit, only freeze persimmons once; if you let them thaw, make sure you use them. Freezing persimmons twice ruins their texture and flavor.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_store_Fuyu_persimmons></span>How do you store Fuyu persimmons?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Fuyu persimmons will keep for months if <b>stored in a dry, dark, cool place.

Unripe they have a crunchy texture, and as such can be diced and added to <b>vegetables and grain salads, salsas, or sliced on a cheese platter.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=Can_you_put_persimmons_in_the_freezer></span>Can you put persimmons in the freezer?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you’re worried about freezer burn, place your persimmons into an airtight container before you freeze them. <b>You can freeze whole persimmons indefinitely, but they’ll start to lose their taste and texture after about 3 months</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_prepare_persimmons_for_freezing></span>How do you prepare persimmons for freezing?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Scoop the persimmon puree into airtight freezer-safe containers. Seal each container tightly, then put them into your freezer.

Then wrap persimmons individually and overwrap tightly for storage in freezer. You avoid bruising the fruit if you wrap it after it is frozen.

The persimmons had been picked from a neighbor’s tree; while they were orange when picked and on their way to ripening, they were still hard and not yet edible.</b></p><h2><span class=ez-toc-section id=How_do_you_store_persimmons_long_term></span>How do you store persimmons long term?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Persimmons should be kept <b>at room temperature until ripe.
