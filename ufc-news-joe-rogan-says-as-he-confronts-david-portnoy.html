The decision wasn’t very well received by many fighters and they took to Twitter to say that the decision was “disgraceful”. Paddy Pimblett has been losing fans for not accepting or even acknowledging the split decision, he maintained that the fight was not even close and he was the “clear” winner.</p><p>When David Portnoy asked <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Joe Rogan</a> about the fight, he may have expected an agreement to the decision but Rogan stood his ground that <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Jared Gordon</a> deserved to win that fight.
