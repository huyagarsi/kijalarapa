But in real life, the 24-year-old singer (real name: Stefani Germanotta) is celibate.</p><p>While recently discussing her role in Mac’s Viva Glam campaign, which supports global HIV and AIDS projects, she told London's&nbsp;<a href=#>Daily Mail</a> she wants her fans not to have sex, either.</p><p>"I can’t believe I’m saying this – don’t have sex. I’m single right now and I’ve chosen to be single because I don’t have the time to get to know anybody," she said. "So it’s OK not to have sex, it’s OK to get to know people. I’m celibate, celibacy’s fine."</p><p>She said her celibacy is something she wants "to celebrate" with her fans.</p><p>"It’s OK to be whomever it is that you want to be," she said. "You don’t have to have sex to feel good about yourself, and if you’re not ready, don’t do it. And if you are ready, there are free condoms given away at my concerts when you’re leaving!"</p><p>The important thing, she said, is for her fans to stay true to themselves. "I remember the cool girls when I was growing up. Everyone started to have sex," she said. "But it’s not really cool any more to have sex all the time. It’s cooler to be strong and independent."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She added that she is proud to be a role model. "When you’re in the public eye, you’re a role model whether you want to be or not. And I want to be," she said. "I’m not one of those self-obsessed artists who don’t care about their fans. It’s not just about the music."</p><p><a href=#>PHOTOS: Lady Gaga and other stars who had bad haircuts in 2009</a></p><p>She said she has a "responsibility" to her fans and that "and you’re an idiot if you don’t know that."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmZSueqitxppkoqVdmLKttcGaq55lkaOxbrzRqKydZZ%2BbeqrAjGtnamhhZoFw</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
