Elder is suing Nirvana and the estate of Kurt Cobain for "trafficking" his image for profit, and causing "lifelong damages."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cobain was found dead at his home in Seattle in 1994. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Elden</a> said in court docs reviewed by <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">CBSLA</a>, that his "identity and legal name are forever tied to the commercial sexual exploitation he experienced as a minor which has been distributed and sold worldwide from the time he was a baby to the present day.</p><p>In the suit filed in a Los Angeles federal court, Elden said his parents never gave their release in writing for the photos, and were not paid. The image was snapped in 1990 at the Pasadena aquatic center when the Los Angeles native was four-months-old. The famous album cover, which late lead singer Kurt Cobain picked out, shows a naked baby swimming underwater toward a dollar bill on a string.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Elden's legal team said in the suit that "to ensure the album cover would trigger a visceral sexual response from the viewer, (photographer Kirk) Weddle activated Spencer’s 'gag reflex' before throwing him underwater in poses highlighting and emphasizing Spencer’s exposed genitals."</p><p>The suit goes on to state: "as an essential element of a record promotion scheme commonly utilized in the music industry to get attention, wherein album covers posed children in a sexually provocative manner to gain notoriety, drive sales, and garner media attention, and critical reviews."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>According to Elden, the 90's grunge band had promised that a sticker would be placed on the area of his genitals, but it never occurred. Elden is asking for $150,000 from each of 17 defendants named in the suit - much to the disgust of Nirvana fans.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>Fans Are Going Wild For Madonna's 'Nirvana Rendition' Of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'</a></span></p><p>"Took him 30 years to figure this out ?
