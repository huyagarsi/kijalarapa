He’s such a fine man. What I love about Nigerian men is that, they know how to spend on their women. I have dated a Nigerian man. They sweet die! Mad oh! If I get one that wants to marry me why not, I’ll accept the marriage proposal.”</p><p>Chi Chi Neblett also alerted her potential lovers that she is now single and ready to mingle. This pronouncement is coming after she jilted her ex-lover a few months ago for being violent and excessively jealous.</p><p>The Brown Sugar star actress said, “I broke up with my boyfriend on July 30, so I don’t have a man in my life at the moment. I left him because he was unnecessarily jealous. I know men can be jealous, but his own was out of this world, never seen such before. I beg I no want again. I tried but couldn’t help it anymore, so I had to find my way out.”</p><p>Also lamenting on some of the challenges she has encountered with men, Neblett said, “The thing is, most of them think I am too expensive to handle and secondly they feel every man want an actress. But I was not single till July. So now I am the latest single lady In town (Laughs). I am a very faithful lover.&nbsp;Once I have a man who loves and cares about me, I don’t see the need to cheat. So, forgiving a cheating partner will be very difficult I swear. I am mean when it comes to my man, cheating is a no-no!!Sadly, no man in my life for now, so I don’t think of sex of late, I just manage.”</p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.kemifilani.ng/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Entertainment-News-Nigeria-News-Naija-Music1-min.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8CfqaKbkWS7qrPEq6Capl2isq95wKucZqunmrK1edOhnLJlm6O8uHnHqK5mrJ9iwLGxzZ1kqKZdrLyusc1mmqGhXZi1qnnNnpmlnaSpeq21wZ6popmeYq6kwNGeqqxn</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
