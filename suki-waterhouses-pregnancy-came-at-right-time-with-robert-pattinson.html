Waterhouse’s choice to announce the news on her terms — and keep it private until that moment — matches her and Pattinson’s relationship pattern.</p><p>Us confirmed in August 2018 that Waterhouse and Pattinson had been “<a href=#>dating for months</a>” but had flown under the radar. At the time, a source exclusively said that the Batman actor and singer had “known each other” for a “long time” before sparking a romantic relationship.</p><p>It wasn’t until April 2019 that Pattinson first <a href=#>commented on his bond</a> with Waterhouse, telling The Sunday Times that talking about his partner publicly and letting “people in” to his relationship “devalues what love is” for him.</p><p>The pair eventually made their first red carpet appearance together at the Dior pre-fall 2023 menswear show in Egypt in December 2022. The following year, Pattinson and Waterhouse packed on the PDA while attending the 2023 Met Gala in May, sharing a kiss for the cameras.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Shortly before the twosome went public with their pregnancy, Us learned that the Twilight actor and Waterhouse have been actively planning their future.</p><p>“An engagement isn’t necessarily off the table, but it’s not something Suki and Rob are focused on for the time being,” an insider <a href=#>exclusively told Us</a> last month. “They’ve definitely discussed getting married, but there’s no pressure to rush things.”</p><p>Waterhouse and Pattinson “figure that if they’re going to spend their lives together, then there’s no reason to push it,” the source said, adding that the duo are “letting things unfold organically, which has worked out for them so far.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrZueerit056poaelqLK0ec%2BrnKCmkaOwunnCmqSeZZGperO1xqGrZqyZorJuw8itn2aqn5eys8CMqZitrJmjwLC6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
