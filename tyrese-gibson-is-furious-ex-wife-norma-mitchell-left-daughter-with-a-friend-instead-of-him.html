Tyrese says Norma pawned the kid off to a classmate for a one-night sleepover, while she jetted off to Trinidad.</p><p>Presumably, that means Norma left Shayla with a friend on her final day of custody … because Tyrese says Shayla was back under his care the following day.”</p><p><a href=#>Tyrese recently demanded receipts</a> that provided proof of his ex-wife needing a babysitter when Shayla is in her custody.</p><p>The celebrity father claimed that Norma’s expense for childcare stemmed from his ex-wife taking time out to visit the spa and enjoy personal trips sans their daughter. A judge later agreed that Tyrese should not be bound to Norma’s alleged expense of $25 per hour for babysitting if she could not show proof of employment that would lead her to need childcare.</p><p>Shayla is Norma Mitchell and Tyrese’s only child together. Tyrese has two kids in all.
