Which you’re not allowed by the way.”</p><p>While the Bench author revealed that it was a tough situation for her to handle as a kid, when she allowed herself to open up to the experience, she and her mother created lasting memories together.</p><p>“Once I was over that adolescent embarrassment, my mom and I, we would go upstairs, we would sit in a room and we would have a steaming bowl of the most delicious noodles,” Meghan shared.</p><p>Tuesday’s “Archetypes” episode is the first since the death of the Archewell cofounder’s grandmother-in-law, the queen, who passed away on September 8 at the age of 96.</p><p>Meghan and <a href=#><strong>Prince Harry</strong> </a>— who are parents of 3-year-old son Archie and 15-month-old daughter Lilibet — spent two weeks in the U.K. following Her Majesty’s passing, attending multiple public events in the late monarch’s honor and reconnecting with Harry’s estranged family.</p><p>In addition to mourning together at the queen’s state funeral on September 19, Meghan and Harry, 38, also joined<a href=#><strong> Prince William</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Princess Kate</strong></a> to <a href=#>greet the public</a> who came to pay their respects to the late sovereign outside of Windsor Castle.<a href=#><strong> King Charles III</strong></a>, who assumed the throne upon the death of his mother, also<a href=#> extended an “olive branch” to the Sussexes</a> during his inaugural speech as monarch.</p><p>“I want also to express<a href=#> my love for Harry and Meghan</a>, as they continue to build their lives overseas,” the king, 73, stated in his first address to the U.K. as the new sovereign.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Harry and Meghan — who is also estranged from her father, <a href=#><strong>Thomas Markle</strong></a> — have been at odds with the royal family since stepping down from their duties as senior royals in 2020. The rift only grew wider as the couple moved to California with son Archie and <a href=#>later slammed The Firm</a> in a tell-all CBS interview in March 2021.</p><p>As for the possibility of mending fences in the wake of the queen’s death, royal expert <strong>Myko Clelland</strong> exclusively told<a href=#> Us Weekly</a> last month, “I think now is the time grief brings families together, and we’ve seen this coming together. So, if it’s going to happen, I think now is the best possible chance.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGamnZedrq95zJqppKSVYr%2Bmr8Clo6xll6S2r7OMraZmmV2jwqWxjKynmmWnnsGpeceeqWaln6J6or%2BMmmSkoZRk</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
