We got into an argument about me not producing her because she was around me watching everybody else get hit records,” he continued after being asked why he never produced her records.</p><p>“I never wanted her to think that’s what my agenda was, because so many people were saying that,” said Dupri. “When Janet met me, she got picked up at the airport in a Continental T&nbsp;[Bentley], you know what I mean? I’m just sayin’.”</p><p>The 50-year-old said he respected who Jackson was working with at the time, which he tried to explain to her.</p><p>“It was actually a thing where I didn’t really know how to say it,” he said. “Because everybody else I was producing, but I was, I was at a point where I was like, ‘I’m not getting ready to do this with you because I don’t want to be the person that mess it up, and I respect [producers] Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis.’</p><p>“Those guys are like gods to me, so I’m like, ‘You don’t need me,’ but in her eyes, in what she saw everybody else doing, that didn’t sound right,” he explained.</p><p>The So So Def CEO went on to say that the argument caused a rift in their relationship. He said he would mention if he saw other producers making mistakes and Jackson would reply, ‘Then why the f— you ain’t doin’ it?'”</p><p>Although he has not produced her music, Dupri made an appearance in her “Gotta Getcha” music video in 2005. He also was a featured guest on her track “Someone to Call My Lover (So So Def Remix).”</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>janet jackson in jermaine dupri’s “gotta getcha” music video, 2005 <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gZcM4YDLJC</a></p>— ‎ً (@hourlydamita) <a href=#>November 23, 2022</a></figure><p>The Jasmine Brand shared a clip of Dupri’s interview on Instagram, and fans reacted harshly to his remarks. One fan <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">replied</a>, “I still can’t believe THE Janet Jackson gave his gremlin looki-nevermind.”</p><p>“She really loved him and he cheated.

After sending messages through her stylist, he bought her a pager to communicate with him directly. She <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">contacted</a> him, and the rest is history.</p><p>Their relationship ended in 2009 mainly because “she wasn’t willing to move to Atlanta,” said Dupri, adding that she was only willing to visit for weeks at a time.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZpKGur8DAm6Oam5uowaK%2BjZympmdiZX90e49tZmlpX6i1pnnDopunrF2jsqawjKacZqKVp7qitc2eZJ2toKe2br%2FAsqpmopGjsrV5yZqapKufo3q4rdJmpJqcXZ2ybrDInaWtZaeWu7V506hkqaqfmcKksYyhnKtlnarAqq%2BMsJ%2BipJViwamx2GaunqqVYrGiwMinnmg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
