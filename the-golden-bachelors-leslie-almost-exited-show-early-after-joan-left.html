News</a> published on Thursday, October 26. Her son, however, asked her to “please stay” on the ABC dating series, insisting that she should continue on her journey with Golden Bachelor <a href=#><strong>Gerry Turner</strong></a>. Leslie is the mother of three kids — Elijah, Chloe and Zack — as well as a grandmother to three grandkids.</p><p>Her son’s phone call came days after fellow contestant <a href=#><strong>Joan Vassos</strong></a> — whom she described as one of her “best friends in the house” — left the series to help out her daughter who recently gave birth. If not for her son’s persistence, she would have followed suit with Joan, 60.</p><p>“With our age comes life. And just because your kids are bigger doesn’t mean they don’t have problems,” Leslie told the outlet. “So, we’re a mother first and if my son had said, ‘I need you now,’ I would have left. Because that’s who I am.”</p><p>If she had left the series early, she likely would have missed her first one-on-one date with leading man Turner, 72, later that day. The pair “had the best time” riding through the California desert on ATVs before making out in a hot tub.</p><p>“[My son] gave me the gift of staying and having an amazing date with Gerry, which I think changed our relationship, took it to a different level,” Leslie added.</p><p>While Leslie almost went home before her date, Joan announced her departure after enjoying a romantic one-on-one dinner with Gerry after episode 3’s group date. She <a href=#>addressed her exit</a> via <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> following the show’s October 12 episode, explaining that she “traded the mansion for motherhood and headed home to be with my family.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Golden-Bachelor-s-Leslie-Fhima-Nearly-Had-to-Make-an-Early-Exit-Like-Contestant-Joan-Vassos-481.jpg><p>Joan continued: “Once a mother, always a mother, I’ll always choose my kids first. Thank you for all of your outpouring [of] love and support, for not only me but also my daughter — everyone is now healthy and happy! As for me and my journey to love … guess we will have to see where it takes me next. Until then, stay golden ✨✨🌹.”</p><p>Much like Joan, contestant <strong>Marina Perera</strong> <a href=#>ended her Golden Bachelor journey early</a> after receiving a rose from Gerry on night 1. In a <a href=# rel=noopener>deleted scene</a> shared on the show’s social media pages, host <a href=#><strong>Jesse Palmer</strong></a> informed Gerry that Marina, 60, left the Bachelor Mansion to tend to a family situation back home. “I’m a single mom and I had to choose my family and, you know, support my family’s needs at this time,” she explained to Gerry via FaceTime. “I am so sorry that I had to leave, but at the same time I had to get my priorities straight.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/The-Golden-Bachelor-s-Leslie-Fhima-Nearly-Had-to-Make-an-Early-Exit-Like-Contestant-Joan-Vassos-482.jpg><p>Meanwhile, <strong>Nancy Hulkower</strong>’s self-elimination was not family-related but rather was about her connection with Gerry. “You’re a lot more passionate with other people. I think you’ve, in a way, narrowed it down, but maybe I’m not in that group,” she told Gerry during the group’s <a href=#>afternoon cocktail party in episode 4</a>, to which he responded, “I’m really not gonna dispute that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>As a result of that — as well as ending up in a boot after sustaining a leg injury during the pickleball group date — Nancy decided to leave the series.</p><p>The Golden Bachelor airs Thursdays on ABC at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKuhnV2cvK2wxKdkm5mTnbKtu9GsZKWdo6G2pnnApaSoq6Risrm1056bZquYpMRuscCro7JlkZvBpr6Mo6aapl2hsqfAjg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
