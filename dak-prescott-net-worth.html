But Dak Prescott rose up the depth chart due to injuries, and he took over the starting role in week three of the 2016 preseason. Dak impressed coaches with his play and held down the spot.</p><p>Prescott won the Pepsi NFL Rookie of the Year and the AP NFL Offensive Rookie of the Year and was named to the PFWA All-Rookie Team. He was also a Pro Bowl selection in 2016. Prescott started all 16 games and threw for 23 touchdowns and 3,667 yards.

There had been whispers that he would almost certainly sign a $100 million extension, perhaps as much as $140 million to match <a href=# title="Jimmy Garoppolo Net Worth">Jimmy Garoppolo</a>'s 2017 deal. But that did not happen.</p><p>In August 2019, <a href=#>Dak turned down a multi-year deal</a> that would have paid $30 million per year. <a href=#>Rejecting this offer seemed like a bad call</a> a few months later when Dak <a href=#>suffered a horrific leg injury that many thought was career-ending</a>. Fortunately, it was not career-ending.</p><p>On March 8, 2021, it was announced that Dak and the Cowboys had agreed to a four-year, <a href=#>$160 million contract</a> that came with $126 million guaranteed. The deal came with a <a href=#>$66 million signing bonus</a>, the highest in NFL history at that point. Over the first three years of his deal, he would earn an <a href=#>average of $42 million per year</a>.</p><p>Dak Prescott has earned over $131 million in salary alone from the NFL and upwards of $50 million more in endorsements from his sponsorships with AT&T, Adidas, Pepsi, Campbell's Chunky Soup, Sleep Number, New Era, Beats by Dre, Direct TV, 7-Eleven, Oikos, and CitiBank.</p><h2 id=personal-life><strong>Personal Life</strong></h2><p>Dak Prescott was the youngest child with two older brothers, Tad and Jace, an older sister, Natalie Prescott-Smith, and an older half-brother, Elliot Prescott.
