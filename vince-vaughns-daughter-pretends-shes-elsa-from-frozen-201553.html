I think Frozen is great,” the Unfinished Business actor noted. “But it’s interesting to me because of the two ladies in the movie. One is all in with the first guy she meets, right?” he said of Princess Anna. “She’s just: ‘Here’s my heart, here’s everything,’ and then, you know, he kind of turns out not to be the best of choices.”</p><p>Little Lochlyn, though, has come to “idolize” Anna’s big sister, Snow Queen Elsa. “She doesn’t want to get too close to anyone, because she’ll hurt them — she’ll freeze them and she’ll cause them pain so she has to shut herself out,” Vaughn said of Elsa’s characteristics. “I wonder what a child psychologist would say about this, but my daughter puts on the white wig and then she is Elsa… She says, ‘I’m shutting you out, I’m not good for you. I have to be far, far away.'”</p><p>Vaughn speculated that a “little role-playing” and “imagination” were good for kids, but he wondered whether he and his wife <strong>Kyla Weber </strong>were “doing some serious damage” with their tot. “She’ll freeze me and then I’ll go along with it, so maybe I’m encouraging it,” he mused. “I’ll freeze, but then she’ll kiss me and unfreeze me. And so then I say to her: ‘You don’t have to shut me out because if you do freeze me you’ll kiss me to unfreeze me.'”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>While Lochlyn has been mimicking Elsa’s frigid mannerisms, she’s actually been incredibly warm to her baby brother Vernon, 18 months. “She’s enjoying it. She’s very sweet and nurturing,” Vaughn said of his daughter. “Sharing can be a problem sometimes, but for the most part she’s really excited.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“I think she’s excited that he’s staying,” he shared. “She really took to him. She really was excited to have him. I think he’s the one that can be overwhelmed sometimes with the love and affection that comes his way. I mean, he’s glad for it, I’m sure, but I think she definitely is really into having a little brother most of the time.”</p><p>On the show, Vaughn also told DeGeneres what it was like to <a href=#>partake in the Polar Plunge this past weekend</a> in Chicago’s Lake Michigan, where he was joined by <strong><a href=#>Lady Gaga</a></strong> and her fiance <strong>Taylor Kinney</strong>. “That was a decision that was made and there was no turning back on that decision. It was for a good cause,” he shared. “I was absolutely freezing!”</p><p>Watch him take the Polar Plunge above!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaK2ippOaeret1KCfp6tdma62s8etnKtloKeytbHNnapmq5iawG6xy6yYZp6ipLpustGosZ6mXWd9coGUbA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
