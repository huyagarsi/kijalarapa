Then, he said he didn’t want to come at all. Then, he said he would come and not perform. The day of the show there was talk that he might perform.”</p><p>It looked like his speech even shocked his own family members, including his pregnant wife,<strong> Kim Kardashian</strong>, mom-in-law <strong>Kris Jenner,</strong> and sisters-in-law <strong>Kylie Jenner </strong>and <strong>Kourtney Kardashian</strong>. Award presenter and West’s former nemesis <strong>Taylor Swift </strong><a href=#>also seemed shocked</a> by his onstage antics as she stood directly, awkwardly beside Kim in the audience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“Literally, up until he got onstage, no one was clear if he was going to perform or not,” the source adds to <strong>Us. </strong>“No one knew he was going to do that insane speech or what he was going to do.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>In fact, insiders thought he would deliver an impromptu performance when the “FourFiveSeconds” rapper, 38, first got onstage and grinned… without saying anything for several minutes. “When he had that long moment of silence, everyone was sure he was going to start rapping,” the source tells <strong>Us.</strong></p><p>Instead, he started talking. And talking. West delivered an incredibly memorable and completely off-the-wall speech while accepting his career honor. His moment included a mix of “bros, listen to the kids,” sweet fatherhood quotes and anecdotes, an admission that he “rolled up a little something” before hitting up the show, and a bold declaration that he has “decided in 2020 to run for president!”</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Were you surprised by West’s VMAs speech?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKKapqmaerix0q2qZqqZmbakwcuorKxlpqKutHmRaWhuZaOlsqavx2aumqtdoa60wIymoKetpJp6pbHCoqqip55if3F9lGxocQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
