The phone calls when she’s away still tickle me…. asking are her babies ok. 🥰”</p><p>Many fans rushed in the comment section to praise the two sisters: “When you give them siblings at that age group, it is they, babies. ❤️❤️❤️❤️❤️💫💫💫They’re soo adorable‼️ 🥰❤️❤️🥰 God bless you and your princesses 👸🏽 🙌🏽‼️<br>I’m jealous you have those chocolate babies 😍😍😍May God bless them.

Always been a fan of you! Keep growing and glowing boss woman 😘😘. Now I see why Bambi & Scrappy mad, mad 🤣🤣 lol picture says it all…Simply beautiful 👏🏽!”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B1HsnvCpko-/</p><p>A fan of the TV show added: “That sound like your opinion unless you know them personally! That is the father of her child, so they should communicate whether it’s by phone, text, or email Bambi need to relax and worry about why her husband so pressed about Erica’s relationship😳! So clearly Scrappy has the problems duh!”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0Y3yMxJm4v/</p><p>This person chimed in: “That’s a fact no woman that is truly over a man and, has moved on is going to be pressed about communicating by phone with their BD. She isn’t over him, and that’s why she and Bambi have problems.”</p><p>https://www.instagram.com/p/B0nyBYrl8DI/</p><p>Another commenter claimed: “He’s probably wondering why she is still so pressed by him like some of the rest of us……. I wouldn’t want to have contact with a person who goes and fie a restraining order against me cause she was botter about who I was in a relationship with. I mean he wasn’t allowed to contact her during that period at all. Like, keep that same energy sus. Not to mention, she tried to have the court order supervised visits between him and their daughter. She is bitter af trying to use their child as leverage, then trying to have a form of control by her wanting to contact him via talking on the phone. He doesn’t have to bend to her beckon. He is married, and she should respect that. If it isn’t an emergency texting should be fine, and he’ll get back to her when he gets time.🤷‍♀️💯💯”</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Erica is moving forward nicely.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGeVp7akrYydoLGnnmK9sL%2FTrGSrmaKaerG0zq2mZqeWYrWmvoydmK6fmKmys7%2BMnqSappliv6qvx5qpnaufo3qiusNmq7ChnmKvoq7InqpmnpGjwG6%2F06KjpWWUmq%2BiwMinnmaglad6p7HUnWSwoaSdeq21y2aqnKqRpb26ecCnm2avmZuybq7AppmiZZKau7S7zWZqamtja39w</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
