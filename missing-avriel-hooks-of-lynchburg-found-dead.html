Hooks’ tragic death has left more questions than answers as police investigate suspicious circumstances surrounding her disappearance.</p><p>Hooks, described as a responsible young woman not prone to unexpected absences, was last seen by her mother on August 22nd when she was dropped off from work at home. The next day, Hooks failed to show up to her job at the Lynchburg Public Library, prompting worried family members to report her missing.</p><p>The Lynchburg Police Department quickly labeled the disappearance as suspicious and mobilized search efforts across the city and surrounding counties. Friends and family also aided in the extensive search, hoping to find Hooks safe.</p><p>After nearly a week pursuing leads without success, investigators caught a tragic break in the case on August 28th. A body was discovered in a wooded area off U.S. Route 60 in Amherst County, approximately 20 miles from Lynchburg.</p><p>While authorities have not yet confirmed the identity, sources indicate it is likely Hooks. The medical examiner will make the final determination pending an autopsy.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-wp-embed is-provider-oxgaps wp-block-embed-oxgaps"><a href=#>Sophia Petsche Death :Know her Cause of death, Obituary, Gofundme&nbsp;</a><a href=#>Sophia Petsche Died</a></figure><p>Shortly after locating the body, Lynchburg police brought in a person of interest for questioning. The individual, now identified as 21-year-old Michael Perry III of Lynchburg, has been arrested and charged with second-degree murder and the unlawful disposal of human remains.</p><p>Police have not disclosed details on how Perry may have known Hooks or revealed a suspected motive. However, the charges imply detectives believe Perry is responsible for Hooks’ death and dumping her body.</p><p>For now, authorities are releasing limited information as they continue gathering evidence and building a timeline of Hooks’ disappearance and Perry’s movements. Her family and the Lynchburg community are desperate for answers and justice.</p><p>The tragic outcome has cast a dark cloud over Lynchburg, where many residents joined search teams and held out hope that Hooks would be found alive.
