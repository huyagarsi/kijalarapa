She accessorized the killer lingerie look with a pair of giant gold hoops from one of Philipps‚Äô go-to jewelry brands, Jennifer Fisher.</p><p>In the 30-second campaign video and its accompanying photos, Philipps makes a strong case for matching your bra to the rest of your outfit, a habit that the Illinois native tells Us she actually does in real life!</p><p></p><p>Warners bras are the actress‚Äôs favorite as of late, but one of her most nostalgic undergarments dates back to when she was in high school. On May 18, the Busy Tonight host <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted a mirror selfie</a> wearing the bra, which was covered in colorful pom poms reminiscent of an arts and crafts project. Nevertheless, she fit into it like a dream and simultaneously made it look like high fashion.</p><p>‚ÄúLOOK WHAT I JUST FOUND IN A BOX LABELED MEMORABILIA?!‚Äù Philipps wrote in the accompanying caption. ‚ÄúI hope this provides inspiration for ALL OF YOU to start a puffball project of your own this weeküòÇüòÇ! #crafty #puffball #springcleaning.‚Äù</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>So obviously, we had to inquire about whether or not the puffball bra is still a part of Philipps lingerie collection. ‚ÄúOf course,‚Äù she told Us, adding that it‚Äôs so iconic that it deserves to be displayed in a shadow box, for all to admire.</p><p><strong>Listen on Spotify to Get Tressed With Us to get the details of every hair love affair in Hollywood, from the hits and misses on the red carpet to your favorite celebrities‚Äô street style ‚Äòdos (and don‚Äôts!)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmrKypoba0tI6nnLCrX5fCtMWMqZ%2BipJmlvbR50q2Yq6tdnrtuw8CrpZ6qo2KzorjLZmlpamBir7OtjJyYpqiRnrSvedaaq5ygXw%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
