Friday’s court filing, including the formal murder charge against Momeni, revealed that Khazar and Lee were involved in some kind of relationship, however, they didn’t comment on whether it was a romantic one.</p><p>"What we have at this point -- and what we've been willing to release to the public -- is the fact that Mr Momeni does have a sister who was connected to Mr Lee and apparently is what connects the two men, but at this time, we're not revealing any more than what's contained in our detention motion," Brook Jenkins said, San Francisco Attorney, during a Friday afternoon, April 14, press conference. She also revealed that the murder suspect and victim discussed whether Elyassnia used any kind of drugs, but refused to share any further information, as per a <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">CBS News</a> reports.</p><p><strong>READ MORE</strong></p><p><a href=# rel>Nima Momeni: Bob Lee's murder suspect, 38, is related to one of San Francisco’s top plastic surgeons</a></p><p><a href=# rel>Bob Lee murder: Fellow tech executive arrested for fatal stabbing of Cash App founder in San Francisco</a></p><h2 class=split>'He enquired about his sister'</h2><p>The documents state that Lee, the witness, another resident, and Elyassnia drinking at an apartment in the Mission district.
