You guys, this is so exciting.”</p><p>The <i>Happy Endings</i>&nbsp;actress’&nbsp;father, Paul, added, “The baby is a month early but perfectly fine.”</p><p>Wilson, 36, announced on <i>Bitch Sesh</i>&nbsp;in March that she was expecting another bundle of joy. The couple are also parents of 2-year-old son Max. “Some big news on my end, which is that I am pregnant again,” she revealed at the time. “I’m so excited. I was feeling so sick for about a month.”</p><p>In June, the <i>Marry Me </i>alum opened about her second pregnancy in an<a href=#> exclusive interview with <i>Us Weekly</i>.</a></p><p>“I’m kind of keeping it low for now, but I did find out because I’m a control freak,” she said of learning her baby’s gender. “Everyone always says, ‘Oh, we just want to be surprised.’ And I say, ‘Childhood is a huge surprise! You’re going to be surprised alright when a baby is exiting your body. It’s a surprise … [It’s] just between us right now.”</p><span class=caption></span><p>As for big brother Max, she added: “I think he’s as excited as he can be. I’m not sure how much he grasps even though we’ve told him. I think he’ll be incredibly sweet.”</p><p>And while Wilson called Caspe, 38, a “wonderful father,” the duo agreed that they will not have a third child. “This will be the final one,” she told <i>Us</i>. “I grew up with two siblings and so did my husband and I feel like, for us, and especially for me personally, just with a career, I would be maxed out at two in terms of my threshold.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>She continued: “I’m not a pregnant person that has a glow about them. I absolutely love babies, but I don’t love being pregnant.”</p><p>Wilson and Caspe met on the set of the ABC comedy <i>Happy Endings</i> (which he created) in 2011. The duo got engaged September 2013 and tied the knot in Ojai, California, in May 2014.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGacmaOaxm7DyKWqqKZdnLa3sdJmmaKqpJ16uLHLnKamnaNiwKavzqebZpuYnrmledaiq6FllJbDqrCMnJisqJVixHWFkmxqa2c%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
