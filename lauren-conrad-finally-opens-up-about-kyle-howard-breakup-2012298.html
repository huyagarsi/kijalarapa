Neither star said much about their relationship while together, and they were even more tight-lipped after it ended.</p><p>But in an August 29 <a href=# rel=noopener>blog post</a>, Conrad finally opened up about their breakup while doling out relationship advice to one of her single fans. “One thing to keep in mind while you are attending weddings, showers and other events celebrating your friends’ relationships is that these aren’t things you are missing out on. They are things you have to look forward to,” Conrad wrote. “I was in a similar place last year. Twenty-five, newly single and helping one of my best friends plan her wedding, so I know how it can feel.”</p><p>She added, “It can be hard to feel like you have to start from scratch when you have invested so much time with a person, but shortly after my break up I realized something: I wasn’t losing the chance to have love — I was getting the opportunity to do it all over again.”</p><p>Indeed. After being set up by pals on Valentine’s Day, Conrad began dating USC law student <strong>William</strong> <strong>Tell</strong>, 32. Things got serious by July, when the new couple spent five romantic days holed up in a $1,500-a-night suite at the Esperanza resort in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Lauren-Conrad-Finally-Opens-Up-About-Kyle-Howard-Breakup-Lauren-Conrad-and-Kyle-Howard-2009.jpg><p>“She thinks he’s The One,” a Conrad pal told <a href=# rel=noopener>Us Weekly</a>.</p><p>Still, Conrad knows how hard it can be to find love again post-split. (Her famous exes include <strong>Brody</strong> <strong>Jenner</strong>, <strong>Jason</strong> <strong>Wahler</strong> and <strong>Stephen Colletti</strong>.)</p><p>“Another thing to keep in mind is that your best friends’ husbands have single friends and that can be a great way to meet guys. Let your friends know that you are looking to be set up,” the former MTV reality star advised in her <a href=# rel=noopener>blog post</a>. “There is no shame in being a third wheel. Don’t think of it as being the only single person in a group. Instead, think of it as having multiple wingmen (or women) with you and since they are all attached there is no competition.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGalmaWnsq95wqilq5mUYrOqusClo7Jln6Wyr7%2BMrqdmmZKkwrV5yrKjnmWYpMSivsNmmaudkaDCsXmRaWhramltfA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
