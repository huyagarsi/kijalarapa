class=imageCaption>Though it looks like a regular pair of headphones, Enten is a brain-computer interfact (BCI) that reads the electrical impulses put out by your brain</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Neurable CEO Ramses Alcaide says he was inspired to create a ‘mind-reading’ headset by his uncle, who constructed his own prosthetics after losing his legs in a car accident.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I became fascinated with how engineering could be leveraged to improve human mobility, and therefore, human autonomy,’ Alcaide, who has a PhD in neuroscience from the University of Michigan, wrote <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>in a blog post.</a></p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘And through this process, I realized that in order to address these core issues, I needed to go straight to the source: the brain.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Enten, from the Spanish for ‘to understand,’ works like an EEG, monitoring the electrical signals generated by neurons in your brain.&nbsp;</p><img decoding=async id=i-2e7409f7e6162ae3

machine-learning algorithms to recognize what your brainwaves look like when you’re concentrating or distracted</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>But instead of sticky, unattractive electrode pads, its sensors are made of cloth—meaning the headphones can easily slide on and off.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Operating on the theory that humans typically have only two to three hours of high productivity a day, Alcaide says Enten can suggest breaks, block notifications and increase noise canceling to maximize your focus across the entire day.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The system’s accompanying app uses machine-learning algorithms to recognize when your brain is concentrating or distracted.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Enten is ‘intelligent,’ Alcaide says, ‘leveraging passive controls to minimize distractions, and active controls to auto-mute notifications when you’re in the zone.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The interface will eventually add new categories of metrics, <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>The Washington Post</a> reported, such as keeping track of how often you fidget, drink water and smile.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The company even envisions being able to chose a song from your playlist with a facial gesture.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Neurable began <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>taking preorders</a>&nbsp;for Enten on Tuesday: The $279 price is an ‘early bird’ discount rate from the original $399 price

detects that you’re having trouble concentrating, it can pause notifications, suggest a break or help block out outside noise</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>That makes them considerably less expensive than Versus’ mobile EEG headphones, which retail for $1,500.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Right now, Neurable just has a working prototype for Enten, but according to the company’s <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noopener" href=#>IndieGoGo campaign</a>, functional sets will ship in May 2022.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Earlier this month, researchers at Brown University reported they had successfully tested a wireless BCI system able to let people with paralysis to type on a computer screen.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Traditional BCIs are tethered to a large transmitter with long cables, but the scientists replaced the cords with a small transmitter that sits atop the user’s head.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The equipment is just two inches in diameter and connects to an electrode array within the brain’s motor cortex&nbsp; through the same kind of port used by wired systems.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In the trials, dubbed ‘BrainGate,’ two men paralyzed by spinal injuries were able to type and click on a tablet just by thinking of the action.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Unencumbered by cables, the men were able to use the BCI continuously for up to 24 hours, giving the researchers data even while they slept.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Elon Musk is developing a similar wireless BCI with Neuralink, but it’s implanted in the brain rather than external.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>To date&nbsp;Neuralink has only been tested on animals: Earlier this month, a monkey with the implant was able to play the video game Pong without a joystick, using only the electrical signal from its brain.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid
