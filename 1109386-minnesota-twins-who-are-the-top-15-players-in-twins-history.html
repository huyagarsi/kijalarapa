Newman was a super utility man, having played five different defensive positions for the Twins in 1987. While he wasn't much with the bat (having a .231 batting average over his five seasons with the Twins), he gave manager Tom Kelly a good glove at any position he needed Newman at. He was also one of only seven players to play for both of the Twins World Series winning teams.</p><p><strong>Dan Gladden</strong></p><p>Gladden was another of the seven players to play for both Twins World Series winning teams. He also scored the winning run in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series after stretching a bloop hit into a double in the bottom of the 10th inning. He was an above average outfielder for the Twins and showed a knack for stealing bases at the most opportune times.</p><p><strong>Eddie Guardado</strong></p><p>The man nicknamed "Everyday" certainly lived up to that title, pitching in 648 games and being named an All-Star twice during his time in Minnesota. In 2002 and 2003 he was the closer for the Twins, shutting the door 86 times. He helped Minnesota to their first and second AL Central titles. Guardado left the Twins on less than great terms, but has finally reconciled his differences with the franchise and is taking part in the Twins spring training in some capacity as a coach this season.</p><p><strong>Gary Gaetti</strong></p><p>Gaetti spent 10 seasons with the Twins and was a part of the team that won the 1987 World Series. He was a two time All-Star and four time Gold Glove winner, as well as three times received votes for the AL MVP award. Throughout his time with the Twins he played as many as four different positions a season and was an integral part of the Twins clubhouse.<strong><br></strong></p><p><strong>Gene Larkin and Randy Bush</strong></p><p>Larkin and Bush both get honorable mention mainly because they were in the group of seven players that won both the 1987 and 1991 World Series with the Twins. It was also Larkin that had the game-winning RBI in Game 7 of the 1991 World Series. Bush played his entire 12 year career with the Twins.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGpoaWiFd3nMoqWnnaOkwaJ507Cgp6tdrLWwecCrnGasmJp6tbvPZmhuZaChrrqx0axkoqZdqcSqutJmn6KrpKS%2Fug%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
