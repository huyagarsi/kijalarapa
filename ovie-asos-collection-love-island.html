Should we be buying a [bucket] hat? Potentially. Usually, Mondays are depressing but 16 September has been declared 'National Ovie Day' as the 28-year-old takes over the ASOS website.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/d080ce8e4c51-ovie-2-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=eLlkmgC5zqrd data-wc=1><strong>SHOP: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Ovie edit, ASOS</a></strong></p><p id=emzLL6iTmZZn data-wc=71>The basketball player, who found love on the show with India Reynolds, has launched his very own style edit, and what's more, he's even been called on to work with ASOS Design on a 7-piece capsule collection which will be available from 23 September. How amazing is that?! It's worth noting that ASOS has never done a celebrity collaboration like this before so Ovie definitely wooed them while on the show.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/c62e49d474e9-ovie-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=ecTlKEiCzdge data-wc=1><strong>SHOP: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Ovie edit, ASOS</a></strong></p><p id=e6EBkTBOR19b data-wc=1><strong>RELATED:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Supermodel Isabelli Fontana walked the catwalk at House of Holland</a></strong></p><p id=eKjKrD4VBU0H data-wc=92>The collection - which is available now - centres around utility staples, standout shirts, smart suiting and, of course, a bucket hat or two. With the ASOS Design collab, Ovie chose his dad as a source of inspiration for his debut fashion collection. Ovie’s father PappiRay is an artist and a member of the Nigerian arts society producing incredible art using a mix of media and textures. After visiting PappiRay’s studio, the design team used thought-provoking statements from sketchbooks, such as ‘A World Without Flags’ to reinvent organic cotton hoodies and sweatshirts.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/23bf9d773f73-ovie-4-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e5y2t1bog56W data-wc=1><strong>SHOP: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Ovie edit, ASOS</a></strong></p><p id=eeqcPcIwRMyG data-wc=38>"This whole project has meant a lot to me … I think fashion is huge for showing who you really are. It says a lot about you," he told <strong>HELLO! </strong>at an exclusive first look at the collection.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=euKRpPM_nHge data-wc=108>The heartthrob said: "Family is huge for me. My dad is a big part of me growing up, and a big part of what I can remember is him just spending hours and hours and hours in the studio just getting lost in sort of his own world. I used to just go in there and listen to him playing his loud music and seeing him make all these pieces and he used a lot of mixed mediums, he used a lot of wood and a lot of different metals … so I really wanted to incorporate that [in my designs] when it came down to the textures."</p><p id=ewB23kI0fzsC data-wc=12>Graphics on long-sleeve and short-sleeve t-shirts draw reference from Ovie’s dad’s paintings.&nbsp;</p><p id=eJzRyWeBix8q data-wc=1><strong>MORE:&nbsp;<a class=hm-link href=#>Victoria Beckham wears her SS20 collection straight off the catwalk</a></strong></p><p id=eaMnHrYrUSxo data-wc=62>"All the pictures that I picked out, all the imagery from his artwork, meant something to me… I felt like that was really important. I didn't want to put something out that was like 'oh yeah, this, this, this and this, go on…' and when I first spoke to ASOS, I said I wanted it to be a dope representation of myself."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/a7f651720f7b-ovie-soko-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e1mtYRnwIez1 data-wc=1><strong>SHOP: <a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Ovie edit, ASOS</a></strong></p><p id=egoCQR-tgQeW data-wc=51>Of course, true Ovie fans will love him for his iconic villa catchphrase "message" whenever anyone got a text, and luckily it features as sleeve detail on hoodies and is printed across bucket hats. A logo created by Ovie and inspired by one of his father’s paintings features on each piece.</p><p id=eI6HnEBAaeta data-wc=27>The Ovie Style Edit is available now, and the ASOS DESIGN collaboration will be available from 23 September.
