Maybe get your facts straight before u start making claims like that,” Cavallari responded. “I’m proud to be injectable free.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jay-Cutler-and-Kristin-Cavallari-finances.jpg><p>The Very Cavallari star — who shares three children, Camden, 6, Jaxon, 4, and Saylor, 3, with husband <a href=#><strong>Jay Cutler</strong> </a>—shared that same sentiment in January 2017 when she spoke with Us Weekly about <a href=#>how she maintains</a> her youthful glow. “My goal is to never get Botox,” she told Us at the time. “My mom has never done anything with her skin and she looks great, so hopefully I’ll be OK, but that’s my goal. I’m going to do everything I can to not get any injections.”</p><p>In November 2018, the Balancing in Heels author also shared her tips on staying fit. “I try to work out five times a week. Once I turned 30, it was like that fifth day made a huge difference,” she told Us. “I eat whatever I want, I enjoy it and then I get back on track, so it’s just consistency.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGakqpmowaq6jJyYr5mcoa6ztYyso5qlo2K9ra3SraCcZaOqv6ix0bJkq62dpL%2B0ecinoZ6bpJavrbGMn6menV8%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
