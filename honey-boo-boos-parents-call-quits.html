She’s decided to go ahead and leave her husband, Sugar Bear, because she’s found out he’s not all that he’s cracked up to be. The couple has been married for several years, and even held a recommitment ceremony in 2013 to renew their love for one another. However, it seems their love is not the forever kind, and Mama June has made a big decision.</p><p>“Sugar Bear and I have decided take some time apart to figure out some things in our relationship. We are taking things day by day, but regardless of what happens, the girls will always be our number one priority. We want to thank y’all for your support,” June Shannon (Mama June) said to her fans in a statement.</p><p>The 35-year-old mother of four became famous when she and her youngest daughter, Honey Boo Boo, were featured on the TLC show Toddlers in Tiaras. Honey Boo Boo, 9, is a child beauty queen whose big personality and hilarious statements landed her and her mother a spin off show on TLC called Here Comes Honey Boo Boo. Sugar Bear is Honey Boo Boo’s father, and he’ spent his entire relationship with Mama June acting as the father for her three older daughters, as well (Chubbs, Chickadee and Pumpkin).</p><p>When the couple decided to renew their vows last year, Mama June said to her fans, “Never settle for a man who doesn’t treat you right. If a guy doesn’t love everything about you, move on! There are plenty of other fish in the sea,” she said of her soon-to-be ex.</p><p>It seems that Sugar Bear isn’t treating Mama June right. The reality star found several online dating profiles that Sugar Bear had created online, and she’s not very happy about it.</p><p>(Photo by Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for Ketel One)</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCtp5%2BXe6S7zGifqKaVrnqju85mmaino2K9or7Ep6usZZOWua150K6gratf</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
