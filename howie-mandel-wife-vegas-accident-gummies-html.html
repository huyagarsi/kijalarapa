During a recent <a href=#>appearance</a> on Live with Mark and Kelly,&nbsp;Mandel recalled that while “tipsy,” his wife had a fall so nasty that he “could actually see her skull” through a gash on her forehead. (He later clarified <a href=#>to TMZ</a> that she was not drunk, but had taken weed gummies.) According to Mandel, his wife started walking toward a wall, slipped and hit her eye on the wainscoting, and then broke her cheek upon impact with the floor. While telling the hosts what happened, he shared a photo of his wife’s injured face. Somehow, the comedian found a way to tell this story in a way that had the audience laughing throughout.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/clxma9q6v004s3b80q118cb6u@published data-word-count=160>Mandel said he turned on the light to see her lying in a pool of blood, and tried to put cold soda cans from the mini fridge on her forehead in lieu of ice. According to Mandel, she threw the cans across the room in pain, creating a scene that initially made responding security suspicious that he was responsible for her injuries. To his dismay, his wife apparently leaned into this; he told TMZ that she joked, “Howie, I promise I’ll be a good girl” as they passed people on their way back from the hospital. Looking back, Mandel now also seems to find parts of the experience funny, quipping that his takeaway from the incident is that “marriage isn’t easy.” He added that his wife has made a full recovery and doesn’t have any scarring. Sure, maybe there’s no physical marks left, but what about the potential emotional scars of having a literal bad trip immortalized in the press?</p><h2 class=sources>Sources</h2><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>Live with Kelly and Mark</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><a class=source-link-title href=#><span>TMZ</span> <span class=svg-wrapper></span></a><h3 class=related-title data-editable=title>Related</h3><ul class=related-links data-editable=relatedItems><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/cko2wdg3m0000jrn7ds5cwfle@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Howie Mandel Listened to the Audience, Not His Fellow Comics</span></a></li><li class=related-link><span class=svg-wrapper></span><a href=# data-track-type=article-link data-track-component-name=related data-track-page-uri=www.vulture.com/_pages/clgd5mvvo00000ifr2rtfa08a@published data-track-headline data-track-component-title=Related><span class=headline>Tom Sandoval Airs Dirty Laundry on Howie Mandel’s Podcast</span></a></li></ul><span class=ambrose-short-hed>We’re Just Glad Howie Mandel’s Wife Seems to Be Okay</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7t8HLrayrnV6YvK57wKuropucmnypu9ainGalkaOxpriMsKCfnV2rsqit0maYnJuZmbKvwIygrKalmZrAb7TTpqM%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
