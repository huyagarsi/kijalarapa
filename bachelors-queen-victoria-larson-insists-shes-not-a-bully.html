Bachelor season 25 contestant <a href=#><strong>Victoria Larson</strong></a> defended her behavior during an appearance on Good Morning America on Tuesday, January 26.</p><p>“Honestly, it was all in good fun,” the 28-year-old self-proclaimed “queen” said. “If my words or actions hurt anyone, like, I sincerely apologize and I’ll do better and hold myself accountable. I’m not a bully. I’m really not.”</p><p>When asked whether she has any regrets while watching the season back, Victoria added, “[The other contestants] knew me and knew my heart and knew that I really never have ill intent, so I think they viewed it differently just because they know me.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Queen-Victoria-Larson-Insists-Shes-Not-a-Bully-and-Doesnt-Have-Regrets-Watching-The-Bachelor.jpg><p>The Los Angeles native has made waves since she arrived in a crown during the <a href=#>January 4 premiere of <strong>Matt James</strong>’ season</a>. In addition to insisting she’s royalty, Victoria was accused of bullying<a href=#><strong> Sarah Trott</strong></a> into quitting the show after she and <a href=#><strong>Kit Keenan</strong> said they would make the 24-year-old freelance journalist’s life miserable</a> if she stayed. During the Monday, January 25, episode of The Bachelor, Victoria was quick to team up with <a href=#><strong>Anna Redman</strong></a> to talk about accusations that newcomer <a href=#><strong>Brittany Galvin</strong> </a>was an escort.</p><p>“I anticipated being well-received, so to get, like, the bullying messages and the hate mail and the death threats, [I] wasn’t really prepared for that at all,” Victoria said on GMA. “100 percent, it was shocking.”</p><p>While Victoria admitted that “snatching the crown” off of former Miss Puerto Rico <strong>Catalina Morales Gómez</strong> during Monday’s episode “was not my best moment looking back,” she reiterated that all of her actions were “all in good fun.”</p><p>She concluded, “I don’t think my kindness really got to show through and I really do have a good heart. I actually became friends with one of the new girls.”</p><p>Victoria has also <a href=#>made headlines for her recently resurfaced mugshot</a>. The health coach was<a href=#> booked in 2012 for stealing more than $250 worth of merchandise from</a> a Publix grocery store in Florida.</p><p>“When the story [initially] broke, I called my dad, of course,” Victoria said on Tuesday. “And he’s like, ‘How do you feel?’ And I’m like, ‘I feel liberated!’ Like everything is exposed. I can tell my future husband Google me; I have no secrets to hide.”</p><p>Matt, for his part, had nice things to stay about the controversial contestant on “Bachelor Happy Hour” earlier this month.</p><p>“Victoria is hilarious,” he told <a href=#><strong>Rachel Lindsay</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Becca Kufrin</strong></a> on their podcast. “She is one of the wittiest people I’ve ever met. … She’s unapologetically herself. She’s the quickest. You’ll say something and she’s got something, and then she’s out.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Queen-Victoria-Larson-Insists-Shes-Not-a-Bully-and-Doesnt-Have-Regrets-Watching-The-Bachelor-02.jpg><p>ABC executive <a href=#><strong>Robert Mills</strong> has also spoken out about Victoria’s role on the series.</a></p><p>“Before, we’ve had ‘shades of grey’ villains, where you understand them more and there is maybe more sympathy for why they would do certain things. This is more black-and-white in that people just absolutely hated her. I totally get why that could be a turn-off to some people,” he told Variety after Monday’s episode. “I’m not saying the show is made purely to stir up drama, but certainly a strong personality like [Victoria] is good. And look, Matt has said that is something that he is attracted to — a woman who is her own woman and who is strong-willed — so you can’t argue that Victoria is not that.”</p><p>The Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaJmam5iaubC%2B0maorp2Vo3q3tcKtpquhkWK5or7SqKVmoZ6otrTA0maqoZ2jYruwwIyaZJutnKHGcA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
