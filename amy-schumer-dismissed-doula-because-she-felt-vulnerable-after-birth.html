She’s an actual floating siren around the house. And she’s so just lovely, and when she touches you, like you just kind of melt. She was really a family member.</p><p>“And, I just felt so vulnerable. I was like, I can’t have this Botticelli goddess floating around my home when I am, like, bleeding out.</p><p>“I just didn’t have the strength to allow myself the luxury of having her around our home. I was like, I think you can’t come anymore.”</p><p>Shortly after Amy and her husband Chris Fischer welcomed Gene into the world in May 2019, the 41-year-old comic told fans she had felt very “lucky” to have Domino by her side throughout her pregnancy.</p><p>She wrote on Instagram at the time: “Ok here’s my post baby annoying post and my takeaway from pregnancy. Women are the s***.</p><p>“Men are cool and whatever but women are f****** warriors and capable of anything. I was lucky enough to get to have a doula. Her name @domino_kirke @carriagehousebirth,</p><p>“What do doulas do? I don’t totally know But what she did was make me and Chris feel totally secure and supported throughout my pregnancy and the birth process. I really recommend getting one if you can.(sic)”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOmqSyZaOYtba5xKtknaGjora0v8SdZJ2npaGubq7EnJiuq5ViwKmxjJ%2Bcpaxdq8KtusSrmJuklWKup8DEq2SboaKptXA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
