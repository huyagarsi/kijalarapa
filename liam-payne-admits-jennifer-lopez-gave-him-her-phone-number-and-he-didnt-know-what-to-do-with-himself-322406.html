During an interview, singer Liam Payne revealed that he received the huge honor of knowing J.Lo.’s phone digits.</p><p>If that doesn’t say he’s made it, what does, right?</p><p>In fact, it all started with a visit to the superstar’s house!</p><p>While a guest on Capital Breakfast with Roman Kemp, Liam shared the story of how he got J.Lo.’s number.</p><p>‘I was songwriting a lot, and producing different things. I had a roster of about fourty songs that just sat there. And somebody introduced me to someone that knew J-Lo.’</p><p>Because they had this mutual friend, Liam eventually got invited to Lopez’s home.</p><p>He gushed that ‘It was the most gorgeous house I have ever seen. She met us at the door and then we just sat in this little studio she had in the back and I played her a bunch of different songs. She started dancing and I just sat in the chair like, ‘What the hell’s wrong with my life?’ When I was leaving, she went like, ‘Oh take my number.’’</p><p>Obviously, the singer could not believe what he was experiencing was real life!</p><p>As for how he reacted to the offer, Liam admitted that he had no idea what to do with himself.</p><p>‘I was kind of a bit lost in the whole situation. I was just like what’s going on in my life right now?’</p><p>The star shared that he even saved the contact in his phone as ‘Jenny from the Block!’ How fun!</p><p>Advertisement</p><p>Sadly, he never got to call her and is not even sure he still has the digits after apparently breaking the device.</p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo77IrbCipqOesaa%2BjaipoGecnq6uec%2BasKedXZaxrrXTrGSjnZ6jtqex0WajqKiVr3qordWeZKGhnWK1pr6MqZ%2BoppViu7a5wZ6pZpmemXqpsYydoJ2mpGK4r7vWZq6hmaRiwbB5w6hksKGknXqptcysnKWeXWh%2Fc4CPb2Y%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
