The dedication to her career made her end her relationship with Micheal B Jordan.&nbsp;</p><p>Jordan was ready for a committed relationship, but Lori wasn’t prepared to settle down yet. She realized they weren’t on the same page and that sacrifices had to be made. Although they still care for each other, Lori wants to be known for her accomplishments rather than the people she dates.</p><p>The model won’t compromise her happiness or settle for less than what she knows she deserves. Lori is determined to continue moving forward with her career and personal growth.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Screenshot_20230419-212403_1.jpg><p>Were you inspired by how Lori Harvey built her net worth?
