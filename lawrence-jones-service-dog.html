He <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> three photos of the adorable pup on Instagram, and it's safe to say everyone instantly fell in love with her. Nala has since become a staple on Lawrence's social media pages, but believe it or not, he didn't open up about her until a few months later.</p><p>During the March 28, 2023, episode of Ride to Work With Abby Hornacek, the Texas native <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">shared</a> his love for his dog, telling the titular host, "Nala has been a gift to me."</p><p>Lawrence then explained how he met Nala, telling Abby, "I got assigned this story of this Special Forces operator dog named Raptor, and Raptor is one of the most decorated canines, especially during the war on terror."</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"></figure><p>"And so, me and Raptor formed this connection," he continued. "[She's a] very tough dog, but she just would not leave me alone, and so the Special Forces operator looks at me and goes, 'I feel like you want one.'"</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><p>Lawrence "jokingly said, 'Well, if you can find me one from Raptor's bloodline, I'll get one.' So on Labor Day, he sends me a picture and goes, 'Brother, I found you one,' and it's a picture of Nala. I got so attached."</p><p>Since then, Lawrence and Nala have been attached at the hip. And when she's not training with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Baden K9</a> to help U.S. veterans with PTSD, this sweet little pooch is living her very best life.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><h2 data-header=true class="sc-WZYaI IusWG">What happened to 'Lawrence Jones Cross Country'?</h2><p>On Sept. 9, 2023, Lawrence's show, Cross Country, ended its run. The popular program — which debuted on Jan. 29, 2022 — aired every Saturday at 9 p.m. EST live from Fox News' world headquarters in New York City.</p><p>So, what happened? Well, on Sept. 14, Fox News announced that Lawrence had been named a permanent co-host of the weekday edition of Fox & Friends. As a result, Cross Country was canceled, and One Nation with Brian Kilmeade took over the 9 p.m. Saturday slot.</p><p>Article continues below advertisement</p><figure class="sc-kLokih cgnnmn sc-dTSxUT dyQypj"><p></p></figure><p>Fox revealed that Lawrence's promotion makes him the "youngest Black co-host in cable news."</p><p>The network added, "Lawrence has his finger on the pulse of what matters to communities across America, and his insight has proved invaluable to the FOX & Friends audience. We look forward to welcoming him to our family as he wakes up America alongside our star co-hosts each morning."</p><p>In his <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">own statement</a>, Lawrence said, "I am honored to become a part of the cable news legacy Fox News has created with Fox & Friends, the very show where I made my first ever national television appearance. It is truly a privilege to inform our audience every day, and I can't wait to do so each morning."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoa64vsSnmp5lmqS7pr%2BMrJyrrpmYsm6wzqA%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
