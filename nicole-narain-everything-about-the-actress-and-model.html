Her birth occurred in Chicago, Illinois, indicating her American nationality.</p><p>However, the Chicago native hails from a mixed ethnic background. Her dad has Indo-Guyanese and half-Chinese-Guyanese roots, while her mum is Afro-Guyanese. However, their names and professions have never been mentioned in public.</p><p>Far from being the only child of her parents, Nicole shared childhood memories with two siblings – a brother named Mike and a sister who goes by the name Mimi. Reports revealed that her parents were divorced when she was very young, and Nicole Narain had to grow up under the watch of her mum. According to the model, her mother was overly protective of her kids and called on a daily basis just to check up on them.</p><p>On her academic journey, Nicole is a high school graduate. She is an alum of West Aurora High School, where the Chicago native completed her studies, ran track for her alma mater, and was crowned the academic institution’s homecoming queen for a couple of years in a row.</p><h2><strong>Nicole Narain is a Former Playboy Model</strong></h2><p>Nicole Narain earns her living in the entertainment industry as a model and adult movie actress. Narain launched her modeling career at the tender age of 12, though it was an on-and-off thing at that stage. However, upon the completion of her high school education, the blossoming model relocated to Chicago with the intention of pursuing her modeling career on a professional level.</p><p>She was at a Chicago-based local nightspot known as Circus when Kevin Kaster – a senior editor of Playboy magazine, discovered her. This was how she was featured in the 2000 issue of Playboy Magazine dubbed “Girls of Mardi Gras” which hit the newsstand in March.</p><p>Eventually, in January 2002, Nicole Narain’s status was elevated when the adult men’s magazine featured her as the Playboy Playmate of the Month, and needless to say, this gig marked her emergence into the limelight in the modeling world. In the long run, she recorded several appearances in a handful of Playboy videos.</p><p>Reports said Nicole has done some modeling gigs for fashion brands, but the details are unknown.</p><h2><strong>She is Also a Video Vixen and a Reality TV Star</strong></h2><p>After she gained fame and popularity in the modeling industry, Nicole Narain started attracting the attention of big names in the music industry who wished to feature her in their music videos.</p><p>Eventually, the Chicago-born model recorded appearances in the song, Got Me a Model by renowned musician R.L. She was part of the video for LL Cool J’s “Luv You Better” and Mario Winans’”I Don’t Wanna Know”. Nicole also graced the screen in Fabolous’ video for the track “Baby”</p><p>Narain owes much of her fame to her reality TV show appearances. Notable among them is Fear Factor (the celebrity edition) from NBC. In the show, contestants have to perform crazy challenges like eating live bugs and staying in a snake-filled box to win the grand prize.</p><p>Most of the contestants on Fear Factor described the experience as horrific, and the same goes for Nicole Narain, and it goes without saying that she lost out during their first stunt.</p><p>Nicole’s other popular reality TV show appearance was Sex Rehab with Dr. Drew. She went to the show to talk about her addiction to sex as well as seek treatment for her condition.</p><h2><strong>Nicole Narain and Colin Farrel Briefly Dated in 2003</strong></h2><p>From what is obvious, Nicole Narain appears to be single at the moment, but the Playboy model has had romantic entanglements with several men.</p><p>Notable among her dalliances is Nicole’s relationship with Irish actor Colin Farrell which started and ended in 2003. The duo met a few months after the release of Nicole’s centerfold spread in 2002, and their meeting occurred at the Playboy Mansion, where they both attended an event.</p><p>According to Nicole, they were both free spirits and were quick to recognize the similarity in their personality. The duo eventually hit it off and started dating; their relationship went on to last for six months before they decided to go their separate ways. Nicole explained that separation was done amicably and the reason was too much physical and emotional gap. The two were both in the primes of their career lives and needed to travel a lot which took them away from each other.</p><p>A short while after their split, Colin filed a lawsuit against Nicole Narain in a bit to stop the release, sale, display, and distribution of their sex tape. However, despite his move to terminate the tape, it was later made available on a few internet sites in 2005 and reports said the exes were able to settle their differences amicably later.</p><p>Other men that Nicole dated include American movie star, movie director, rapper, singer, and songwriter Fred Durst. The duo was in an on-and-off relationship between 2002 and 2007.</p><p>In 2004, Nicole became American rapper Nelly’s girlfriend, and in 2008, she dated Christian Monzon. Christian appears to be her last known boyfriend, as she has not been linked to another man since then. Perhaps, the model is keeping her relationship under wraps for now.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLuqr86lnGamkaeuqrqMnq2eqqmptaq6xmaYm6elqXq1tMRmmJysoprAtHnAp5tmpZ%2BZsq17</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
