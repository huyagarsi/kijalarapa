The comedian-actress, 42, who started her career on the variety show MADtv and has a recurring role on Cougar Town as a couples therapist, says Hollywood starlets like <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Jessica Alba</strong></a> are lying when they make such claims.</p><p>"I would flip through celeb magazines…and I just couldn't get how these moms like Jessica Alba lost so much weight so quickly—and yet I couldn't," the actress tells <a href=# rel=noopener><strong>Us Weekly</strong></a> in an exclusive interview at "The Real Women of Jenny Craig" event in NYC on Jan. 23. "They all lie and say, 'Oh, I lost the weight running after the kids or breastfeeding.' It's not true!"</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>PHOTOS: See 2012's babies of the year</a></p><p>"I felt broken. I felt like an outsider in my own community," she continues of her postpartum experience after giving birth to her son, Dashel, now 5. "There just are not a lot of overweight people in Hollywood. I felt like the jerk who couldn't figure it out."</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The actress finally figured it out, she claims, <a href=# rel=noopener>when she signed on with Jenny Craig</a> as its brand ambassador. "I had tried every other diet in the world and decided to give Jenny Craig a try. The first week, I lost five pounds and then lost an average of two pounds a week for 16 weeks. I lost 35 pounds total. It changed my life."</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>PHOTOS: See the healthy meals other celebs swear by</a></p><p>Sullivan has since given birth to another son, Beckett, now 3. "When I look back to when I had my first son, I was unhappy. I couldn't understand why the weight wasn't just falling off. I wish I could have that time back. With my second son, I enjoyed the whole process of him being an infant more because I wasn't mad at myself. When you are mad at yourself, you are mad at everybody. That's the problem…. I may not look like [Alba], but at least I can keep up with other actresses now. I feel really good about myself."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKannah8r7HWrGanoZOkuaZ50q6jpaGmlrtutsSsqqKbkWKura7AZpinnF2kwamx0WaanqSVl3quu8ysZJqqlWK5urXNoGSamp%2BqwW60zrBkraCVrnqtu9KtZK2glWKvoq7YZq6eoZedwW5%2Bj2pqa2xhZA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
