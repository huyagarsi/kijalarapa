While the specific terms of the document are unknown, her Thursday, November 30, filing reveals a penalty if any party cheated throughout the course of the marriage. She is asking for the penalty to be upheld in the divorce decree and also requested an “equitable division” of all marital assets.</p><p class=p1>“Wife further shows that the Court should enforce Paragraph 8 of the Prenuptial Agreement regarding infidelity,” Mai claimed in the court documents, obtained by <i>Us Weekly</i>. “[The clause] provides, in pertinent part, that in the event that either party engages in sexual relations, an emotional relationship, or is emotionally or sexually suggestive in communication with a third party … shall result in a significant financial penalty upon the adulterous party as specified in said Prenuptial Agreement.”</p><p class=p1>The rapper <a href=#>filed for divorce in September</a>, citing that their two-year marriage was “irretrievably broken” and he and Mai were already living in a “bona fide state of separation” prior to his petition.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/jeannie-mai-hints-estranged-husband-jeezy-cheated-in-divorce-filing-asks-to-enforce-prenup-clause-inline.jpg><p class=p1>“This<a href=#> has not been an easy journey</a>. I can tell you that I’m saddened,” Jeezy told<strong> Nia Long</strong> in a YouTube interview posted last month, noting the split occurred after failed couples therapy attempts. “I can tell you that I’m disappointed. I can tell you that I’m uneasy. But God has put me on a different path, and that path is going to entail for me to take care of myself and to love myself and to be in the best situation that I can thrive as someone who’s been through all of the things that I’ve been through.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>In his divorce filing, Jeezy asked for joint physical and legal custody of his 20-month-old daughter with Mai, Monaco. Mai, for her part, is asking for sole “final decision-making authority” regarding Monaco’s care and <a href=#>primary physical custody</a>. She did concur with Jeezy that they should have joint legal custody.</p><p class=p1>Also on Thursday, Jeezy filed a request for a temporary court hearing to settle their custody dispute. He accused Mai of<a href=#> acting as a “gatekeeper”</a> between him and Monaco.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGajnZWvxm6wxKegnqtdmLWmrdOipaBlkah6q7HAp6WinV2irqp5zairnqtdpb%2BmutSpqmahnpu2pbHLoquyZZOhrra%2FxGg%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
