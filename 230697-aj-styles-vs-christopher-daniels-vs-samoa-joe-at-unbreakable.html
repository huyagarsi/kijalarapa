His success hasn’t made him complacent – rather, he’s become more cocky and conceited than ever…even stealing the moniker of “Mr. TNA” from his nemesis AJ Styles.</p><p>After losing the X Championship to Daniels, AJ Styles went on to defeat Jeff Jarrett for another NWA World Heavyweight Title reign. However, AJ’s roots are and will always be in the X Division, a class he helped pioneer and bring to prominence. Fans knew it was only a matter of time before Styles and Daniels would cross paths once more, as there is still plenty to be settled between TNA’s fiercest rivals.</p><p>Enter Samoa Joe into TNA Wrestling – “The Samoan Submission Machine” who has been nothing short of dominant since his debut. In August, Samoa Joe and AJ Styles faced off in the finals of the 2005 Super X Cup, with a shot at the X Championship on the line. “The Samoan Submission Machine” made Styles tap out that night and earned a shot against Daniels, but not before interference in the bout by The Fallen Angel. Now, Styles has his nemesis and the X gold back in his crosshairs, thanks to Championship Committee member Larry Zbyszko, who granted The Phenomenal One entry into the title match – now a three-way for the championship.</p><p>As TNA prepares to take the step to SpikeTV in October, fans will be treated to a bout-for-the-ages on Sunday on Pay-Per-View. The question is, who will walk out with the X Championship? Can Daniels overcome the odds to remain champion? Can AJ Styles reclaim his standing as the leader of the X Division? Or, will both fall to the unstoppable Samoan Submission Machine?</p><p>Tune in on Sunday, September 11 for this X Division Dream Bout for the X Championship, live on Pay-Per-View!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uL7ErKulnaqku6Z6wqikaKaVrMBwfpJpbXJvXZa3br%2FTsqOeq12rwG6vx6ugrKyfpbWmvoydmKehlaHAbsLSZqqapZ%2BWequ7xGaYrWWlo6%2BzscCkmJuklQ%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
