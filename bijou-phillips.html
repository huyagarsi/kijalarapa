She is the daughter of The Mamas and The Papas singer John Phillips and actress-model Geneviève Waïte, but grew up in foster care in upstate New York.</p><p>After years of being a rebellious teenager — she dropped out of school at age 14 and had a stint in rehab three years later — Phillips started her career as a model. She became the youngest model to ever appear on the cover of Vogue Italia before scoring a campaign with Calvin Klein.</p><p>Phillips released an album titled I’d Rather Eat Glass in 1999, the same year she landed her first major onscreen appearance in Black and White. She later had roles in Almost Famous (2000), Bully (2001), The Door in the Floor (2004), Hostel: Part II (2007), Choke (2008) and the Fox sitcom Raising Hope.</p><p>The actress started dating <a href=#><strong>Danny Masterson</strong></a> in 2004 after meeting at a poker tournament in Las Vegas. The couple, both of whom are Scientologists, got engaged in 2009 and married in 2011. They welcomed daughter Fianna on Valentine’s Day in 2014.</p><p>After Masterson was charged with three counts of rape by three different women, Phillips stuck by her husband’s side through the legal process and first trial, which ended in a mistrial in November 2022. He will face a second trial in 2023. (The That ’70s Show alum has vehemently denied all allegations and has pleaded not guilty.)</p><p>“Bijou has been a total rock,” a source exclusively told Us Weekly in January 2022. “She fully supports him and says they’ll get through this nightmare together and come out stronger.”</p><span>More ▾</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOinKxnkp63sMGMqZ%2BipJyevbR7</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
