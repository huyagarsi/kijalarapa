The recovering actress, 27, was asked to reflect on her time filming the series, prompting her to reveal that she suffered a miscarriage during the duration of the show.&nbsp;</p><p>“I cried so many times watching it,” Lohan said of the program. “I don’t see it as me, it’s strange. Of course I’m a bit of a narcissist. Who isn’t in this industry? At the same time, it’s still like, when a camera is on, I’m on. If I know I’m not capable of being on, that’s why I would say I couldn’t film today. No one knows this, and we can finish [the interview] after this — I had a miscarriage for those two weeks that I took off,” Lohan said, beginning to tear up as she spoke.</p><p>The Mean Girls star, who did not specify who the father was, refused to film at one point during the series’ run — leading to a very frustrated crew and even a visit from a concerned <strong><a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a></strong> — explaining that her miscarriage was the reason for the break.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s a very long story but that’s why on the show when it says, ‘she doesn’t want to come down, she doesn’t want to come down,'” Lohan said of her lost pregnancy. “I couldn’t move. I was sick. And mentally that messes with you.”</p><p>“Watching this series, I just know how I felt at that moment and I can relate to that girl, which sounds kind of crazy,” she continued. “I’m like, ‘oh my god, this is really sad. Who’s helping her?’ No one knows what’s going on in my head at every second because I’m constantly thinking. My mind does not shut off.”</p><p><img decoding=async width=467 height=334 src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all" alt="lindsay lohan" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lohan’s discussion of her miscarriage isn’t the only confession she’s made recently, of course. Last week, she stopped by <strong><a href=#>Andy Cohen</a></strong>‘s Watch What Happens Live talk show on Bravo, <a href=#>confirming her much-publicized sex list</a> with the television personality. The starlet explained that the list, which included big names such as <strong><a href=#>James Franco</a></strong>, <strong><a href=#>Justin Timberlake</a></strong>, and <strong><a href=#>Zac Efron</a></strong>, was a part of her recovery process through Alcoholics Anonymous.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m going to get serious for a second,” she said. “That was actually my fifth step in AA at Betty Ford [Drug and Alcohol Abuse Treatment Center]. Someone, when I was moving during the OWN show, must have taken a photo of it. That’s a really personal thing and it’s really unfortunate.”</p><p>Watch Lohan discuss her recent miscarriage in the video above.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vJloZrCvp2PCtLnAoJizoZ6ae6S7zGianqSVl7%2BqwNhmpZ6vo2S7psPSaKOippSorrp5y6ifmqZdora0r8CrqaKZl5p6oq%2FTq5ysq12nsrexwKWqZqSfqMFuvNGenqeZnpjGbrvNZqawpl2otbDDjGtnamxiZoE%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
