ESPN's <a href=# rel=noopener>Dave McMenamin</a> noted LeBron is now one of two players alongside Michael Jordan to have multiple 40-point outings after turning 39.</p><p>The nine threes also tied his career high and prompted the four-time MVP to speak more broadly on his ability to adapt.</p><p>"I don't ever have to lean on [three-pointers] because I can do so much â€” I can score on any level on the floor basically once I cross half court," he said. "But being able to have a growth mindset and be able to work on things that the league is changing to, the league is a heavy three-point shooting league.</p><p>"I'm not one of those guys that wants to go out there and shoot 12, 14 or 15 threes per game. But I want to be respected, and teams have to play me from the outside. That's still kind of one thing teams [think] ... 'If we have to give up something, we'd much rather him shoot the ball from the outside.'"</p><p>James' 41.6 percent clip from beyond the arc is on pace to be a personal best. In general, he has made the three-pointer a larger part of his game since signing with the Lakers. His 6.4 attempts and 32.3 percent attempt rate are his most with any one team, per <a href=# rel=noopener>Basketball Reference</a>.</p><p>Also after Sunday's game, the 39-year-old there's "not very long" left in his NBA career, which isn't all that revelatory given how he has flirted with retirement <a href=# rel=noopener>more openly</a> in recent seasons. Leaning even more heavily into a perimeter game would undoubtedly help extend his time in the Association depending on how much longer he wants to go.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaGlpYWp%2Bdn%2BMpZiknaKoeq2xwaump2Walrqmv4yrnJqbpKh6tbuMo6aippmjtG65yJyfmp2cYrewvsOapWavmam1br7Aq5xmppKWerSvzqugp59dm7KiwA%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
