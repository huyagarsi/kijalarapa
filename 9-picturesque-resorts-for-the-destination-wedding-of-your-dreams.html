And nestled along with is the five-star, five-diamond resort the Four Seasons Resort. Hosting one wedding at a time to ensure an exceptionally tailor-made and memorable experience for the couple and their guests, everything here is timeless and authentically Palm Beach.</p><p>The resort houses both indoor and outdoor wedding venues that lend a relaxed, resort-style opulent touch that the island is known for to each of your events. Host a welcome brunch in the huge living room marked with floor-to-ceiling windows and an attached private terrace garden. Take your vows at their expansive beach or at their pool terrace overlooking the Atlantic ocean. Ornate with lalique chandeliers, mirrored walls and crystal sconces, the Royal Poinciana Ballroom is perfect for cocktail evenings and reception dinner.</p><p>They also offer different wedding packages, each of which can be personalised as per your requirements with a capacity to accommodate 10 to 300 guests. While these packages have common inclusions like premium-brand bar, custom printed menus, wedding cake and three-course dinner menu among others, they also have special features.</p><p>Their Michelin-starred collection includes exclusive collaboration with renowned Chef Mauro Colagreco to give you and your guests an unforgettable culinary experience. While their iconic collection includes special pre-ceremony and reception toasts, the timeless collection offers wine selection from the resort’s private label.</p><p>Similarly, while the classic collection offers an additional reception station with an optional couple entry, the four seasons collection has a wedding cake customised by their executive pastry chef. Additionally, they also have a dedicated team of specialists that will help and ease your entire wedding planning journey until the end.</p><p>The best time to get married in Florida is March through May and November through December. Four Seasons also serves as a great place for honeymoon.
