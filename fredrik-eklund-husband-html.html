They&nbsp;have two children together — son Frederik Jr. and daughter Milla, whom they had via a surrogate.</p><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-8 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Eklund has spoken about how wonderful fatherhood has been for him and has expressed his interest in welcoming more children together. However, having kids was very complicated, and the couple was devastated after their surrogate suffered a miscarriage during her first trimester.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>After tying the knot in 2013, Eklund and Kaplan had planned on having children and hired a&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>surrogate</a> in 2015. However, Eklund opened up about being <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">unable to cope</a> with the situation. “I’m used to being able to pick up myself. But this time I just couldn’t. I was a mess.” <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-612 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>The pair tried once again with the same surrogate a year later. But, unfortunately, she miscarried once again. Eklund was hit hard by the loss again, but Kaplan acted as&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">solid support for the reality star</a>. <span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-10 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-9 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span></p><p>I was in control prior times and it didn’t work out and I couldn’t do it anymore. He took the lead on it. He’s also really been mindful and reminded me that what we’re going through has been hard, but you can’t just take the good without the bad. It’s all of it — the entirety of it is what makes it so amazing.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Eklund and Kaplan tried one more time with a new doctor and a new surrogate and got the news that they were expecting twins. The two welcomed their twins on November 28, 2017.&nbsp;</p><h2>Who Is Frederik Eklund’s Husband?</h2><p><span id=ezoic-pub-video-placeholder-6 class=ezoic-videopicker-video></span>Derek Kaplan is a self-taught abstract artist who began making a name for himself in 2013. Born in Harare, Zimbabwe, in 1975, Kaplan moved to London at 21 and tried his hands at different career paths before going back to painting full time. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>Kaplan had his <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">first solo show</a> in 2013 at the Couture Gallery Contemporary Art Space in Stockholm, Sweden. The show was attended by members of the Swedish Royal family, and all the works on the exhibit were sold the same evening. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-169 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Kaplan’s following few exhibits enjoyed similar success, with all the works on display being sold on the same day.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-long_content"></span><p>Kaplan also got married to Eklund in the same year he held his first solo show.
