The memories we’ve built this past year have been full of laughter, adventure and love,” the benefit calculations analyst captioned a July <a href=#>Instagram</a> tribute to her man. “We’ve become not only lovers but the best of friends. When things got difficult for us instead of running away from the fire we held hands and walked through it together.
