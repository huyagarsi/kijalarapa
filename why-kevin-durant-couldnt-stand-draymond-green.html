It was business as usual for arguably the leagueâ€™s best team for most of the past decade, but not quite for two of its stars, those being <a href=# rel=noopener>Kevin Durant</a> and Draymond Green.</p><p>The first argument between the two teammates took place on January 7, 2017, as the Warriors were in the process of blowing a massive 24-point lead against the Memphis Grizzlies.&nbsp;With 41 seconds remaining in regulation and Golden State up by two points, Green, while running the offense in his usual point forward role, called for Durant to run a pick-and-roll with Stephen Curry (via <a href=# rel=noopener>CBS News</a>). But instead of running this play, Durant called for the ball, held on to it as his teammates watched, and took a contested three-pointer off the isolation play. KD failed to convert, and&nbsp;Green let him have it, screaming that Durant should have listened to him and ran the pick-and-roll. The Warriors would go on to lose that game in overtime, 128-119.</p><p>Almost one month later, Durant and Green were at it again as the Warriors lost a second OT game to a less talented team, the Sacramento Kings. According to <a href=# rel=noopener>NBC Sports</a>, the argument got so heated that reserves JaVale McGee and Shaun Livingston had to serve as the proverbial cooler heads and try to get the two stars to settle down. Green, however, would downplay the tiff, taking to Snapchat a day later and <a href=# rel=noopener>dismissing the rumors</a> of a feud with Durant.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue82erqxnp53GbrfEr6CnZZSqv6K602aaqK2cmbu1edKtmKecXZm%2FosXMqKWdZZensqa6jg%3D%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
