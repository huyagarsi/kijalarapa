Rising to £29m. He has signed a 5yr deal. Medical after Copa America</p><p>Brazil legend <a href=#>Ronaldinho</a> insisted the presence of Firmino alongside Philippe Coutinho is a sign of intent from the Reds (per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Pearce</a>):</p><p><span>It is going to give them one of the most exciting midfields in Europe.&nbsp;</span>The creativity, intelligence, and goals they have between them can change Liverpool as a team. It is a big sign of intent. To have a midfield with those two gives them a big chance to qualify for the Champions League next season.</p><p>It is a dream for the Liverpool strikers to have that sort of service. If you can’t score goals in a team with Coutinho and Firmino in midfield then you wont score goals in any team. They will create so many chances.</p><p>Firmino has enjoyed terrific success at Bundesliga club Hoffenheim over the last couple of seasons, top-scoring for the side, per Opta, while also providing 21 league assists, per <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">WhoScored.com</a>:</p>OptaJean <span class=acct>@OptaJean</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>19 - Only Roberto Firmino has scored more Bundesliga goals for Hoffenheim (23) than @AModeste15 (19) over the last two seasons. Danke.</p><p>While he has played in the centre of midfield, on the flanks and as a striker, he is mainly a No. 10 and has also had success with the Brazilian national side in his fledgling international career.</p><p>Firmino has been an integral part of the Selecao's Copa America campaign in Chile, scoring the winning goal against Venezuela on Sunday to ensure his country finished top of Group C. Brazil will now face Paraguay in the quarter-finals on June 27.</p><p>German football expert Jan Aage Fjortoft applauded Liverpool's move:</p>Jan Aage Fjortoft <span class=acct>@JanAageFjortoft</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Congratulations @LFC with a great signing. Roberto Firmino one of the best available this window.</p><p>Firmino will add a new dimension to the Liverpool attacking line-up, which lacked bite last season. Alongside Daniel Sturridge and international team-mate Coutinho, he will provide a prominent threat to Premier League defences next term.</p><p>Football writer Alex Chaffer is looking for the forward to produce on a more consistent basis in the coming term:</p>Alex Chaffer <span class=acct>@AlexChaffer</span><p lang=en dir=ltr>Firmino delivering at the top level. Hope wherever he is next season, that he can find some more consistency. Such a talent.</p><p>Firmino will bring some real flair to the Reds&nbsp;and could add an edge as they go in search of glory next term.</p><p>The completion of the deal for the Brazilian so early in the transfer window is another boost for Liverpool fans, who have already seen Danny Ings, James Milner, Joe Gomez and Adam Bogdan join the club this summer, while striker Divock Origi is returning from his loan deal with Lille.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmianJqupLTEq6meqJ%2BnwW%2BvzqZmmqqknrCtsdJoaW5oZGeDdnnRqJmeqqSkeqe10aagp6ddqbxuuMivnKuon6S5brjArZysrF2pv6K60p%2Bcq2WUmsGitcusZKudkZjBqrvNZpinnF2ivLOx</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
