Lance previewed the pre-taped interview on HLN’s morning program on Wednesday, January 13.</p><p>In the preview, the two sit down face to face and discuss why Stachowski is suddenly choosing to speak out now. “It’s been 10 years,” Lance notes to her subject. “Why are you talking to me? What do you want people to know?”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p>“The truth,” Stachowski replies. “What a monster he is, and he’s not innocent.”</p><p>Though Stachowski defended Avery in the 10-part true-crime docuseries, she told HLN that she never loved her ex-fiancé. In fact, it was quite the opposite.</p><p>“I ate two boxes of rat poison just so I could go the hospital,” Stachowski revealed to Lance. “And get away from him, and ask them to get the police to help me.”</p><p>The news about the program’s exclusive interview with Stachowski was announced as Grace has made her opinion about Avery’s conviction loud and clear. This past weekend, Grace told reporters during a TCA panel that while she was a fan of Netflix’s series, <a href=#>she had other thoughts about the real-life situation</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src><p><span>“It’s not what I think. It’s what I know,” she told </span><i>Us Weekly</i><span> and other reporters. “Steve Avery is guilty. He murdered Teresa Halbach. He and his nephew [Brendan Dassey] raped and murdered her. I love </span><i>Making a Murderer</i><span>. It’s beautifully put together, it’s just leaving out about 60 or 70 percent of the evidence. I don’t think our justice system should be on the shoulders of two film students. I remember interviewing Steve Avery while we were still looking for Teresa … My knowledge at that time and now is that he brutally murdered this girl. True, he was wrongly convicted on a previous charge, and that’s a miscarriage of justice too. But he killed Teresa Halbach.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>(Prior to Halbach’s case in 2005, Avery spent 18 years behind bars for a sexual assault for which he was wrongly convicted.)</span></p><p><span>Stachowski herself claimed in her HLN interview that the petitions to pardon Avery — after the wildly popular release of </span><i>Making a Murderer</i><span> — are why she’s speaking out now. “She says that the truth needs to come out,” Lance said on HLN’s morning show on Wednesday. “And she says that the documentary is full of a bunch of lies.”</span></p><p>Stachowski’s full interview will air on HLN’s <i>Nancy Grace</i> on Wednesday night at 8 p.m. ET.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGasrJWrsq95wK%2Bcq7GjYrK5ecWimKeblZp6q7vDomSsrJGYtbDD0qSgZqugmq6sv4yhnKxlnqTBbrXNp6acnZ6perh9lWpscm1f</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
