Michelle’s Instagram)</p><p>K. Michelle captioned the photo, “So in my own head ❤️&nbsp;Pretty Thangs.” She added, “No worries, I hardly take offense. Money for revenge, man,that’s hardly an expense.”</p><p>However, fans bombarded the singer’s photo with comments on skin bleaching and said she looked like a “whole white woman.”</p><p>“Harpo who this woman,” one person asked.</p><p>“I specifically remember you being browner sis… This makes me sad. I don’t get what’s wrong with being brown. did&nbsp; I miss something. She just don’t know that Black is beautiful,” another wrote.”</p><p>“Pics getting lighter and lighter..Soon you going to be looking like Marlon Wayans in White Chicks.”</p><p>“The self hate is real!”</p><p>“You looking white and more white in your pic. Please stop what ever it is you’re darker than that. Love the skin you’re in.”</p><p>Other Instagram users jumped to K.’s defense and said makeup and outside lighting were the reasons the artist’s skin complexion looked lighter than normal.</p><p>“It’s call make up and lighting!”</p><p>“Of course when you’re outside you look lighter duhh!!!”</p><p>“Chill it’s make up and the lighting from the sun that makes her look light.”</p><p>The “<a href=#><strong>Love and Hip Hop: Hollywood</strong></a>” star <a href=# rel=noopener>received a lot of criticism on her appearance in March after showing a make-up free photo</a> of herself.
