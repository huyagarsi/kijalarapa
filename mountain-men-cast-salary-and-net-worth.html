They stand at the end of a long line of frontiersmen that dates back to the time of the settlers. These two brothers are determined to live their entire lives in the mountains because they were both born and raised in Idaho’s wilderness.</p><p>Since he was a young child, Harry has been hunting. Even before Harry could walk, his father brought him hunting. He is a big game guide, houndsman, and cowboy. The Youren brothers, who star in the reality TV series, are dedicated to offering a specialized hunting experience dubbed The Youren Experience.</p><p>Running Youren Outfitters and appearing on Mountain Men are the brothers’ main sources of income.
