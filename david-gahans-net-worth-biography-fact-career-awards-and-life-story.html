David Gahan was born in Essex, United Kingdom, in 1962, and worked dozens of jobs before enrolling at Southend Technical College. He joined Depeche Mode in 1980 with Vince Clarke, Martin Gore and Andy Fletcher. The group has been together for more than three daces with 13 studio albums, two remixes and four greatest hits records. Depeche Mode has sold more than $100 million worth of records. He wrote a handful of songs for the band, including “Delta Machine” and “Sounds of the Universe”. In 2003, Gahan released his first solo album called “Paper Monsters” and followed that effort with 2007’s “Hourglass”. His first single off the album, “Dirty Stick Floors”, made it to the top 20 in the UK. The recovering heroin addict has been married three times. He and his current wife, Jennifer, live in New York City with their daughter and Gahan’s adopted son. He has nearly died four times. In 1993, Gahan had a heart attack on stage, and two years later, attempted suicide. In 1996, he overdosed on drugs and had to be revived by paramedics after his heart stopped. Finally, in 2009, he collapsed before a Depeche Mode performance and doctors discovered a tumor in his bladder. Between June 2017 and June 2018, David Gahan and his fellow members of Depeche Mode grossed $55 million.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaJyRq7alecaan5qmo2K7psCMsKarrJhir6q7xquYqaCpYrOir9NmmpqqlZq%2Fbq3Wmqmdq12Wu6V5y6KdnmWjqbyzxY4%3D</p></section></article></main></div><footer><div class=container><span class=copyright>&copy; 2024 MoxBlog - <a rel=license href=http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/>CC BY 4.0</a></span></div></footer><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/banner.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script type=text/javascript>(function(){var n=Math.floor(Date.now()/1e3),t=document.getElementsByTagName("script")[0],e=document.createElement("script");e.src="https://iklan.listspress.com/tracking_server_6.js?v="+n+"",e.type="text/javascript",e.async=!0,e.defer=!0,t.parentNode.insertBefore(e,t)})()</script><script>var _paq=window._paq=window._paq||[];_paq.push(["trackPageView"]),_paq.push(["enableLinkTracking"]),function(){e="//analytics.cdnweb.info/",_paq.push(["setTrackerUrl",e+"matomo.php"]),_paq.push(["setSiteId","1"]);var e,n=document,t=n.createElement("script"),s=n.getElementsByTagName("script")[0];t.async=!0,t.src=e+"matomo.js",s.parentNode.insertBefore(t,s)}()</script></body></html>
